0.8810000000000002,14.052999999999997,C,"The butter... I'm probably not... I couldn't see any potential there, but, you know... Well, the only thing for me... I'm sort of on a similar mind of no, but the only reason it could be useful is for energy and things."
14.173000000000002,19.813999999999993,R,"Yeah. And I thought between the choice of the chocolate and the the butter, I thought the chocolate might have been a better option."
20.373999999999995,26.337999999999994,C,"I was in the same boat, I thought the chocolate would have been a better option there."
26.438000000000017,37.786,R,"Plus also the butter doesn't say how many you get, it just says can of butter, whereas the chocolate bar is simply one per person, which in my mind says more, so if we go for no for that then?"
