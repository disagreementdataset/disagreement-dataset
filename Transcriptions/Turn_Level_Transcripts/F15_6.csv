3.0020000000000095,14.552999999999997,C,"I've also got no, because I can't see what use it'd be without fluid, apart from to create a spark. really, if they had to start a fire, you can still get a spark out of it?"
14.573000000000036,16.89500000000004,R,"No, I never thought about that, yeah, create a fluid."
19.91700000000003,27.123000000000047,C,"You've got no for that, and I've got no, yeah. I've put no instinctively, yeah, I never thought about the spark, but... Can we both change to yes, or...?"
28.745000000000005,42.394000000000005,R,"Yep, well, I think so. But, I mean, what do we think? Still, is it useful? With only the spark? There are other ways of creating a spark. with fire, you know, if they're out in the forest."
42.414000000000044,55.186000000000035,C,"That's true. We'll not get the axe any longer, so that would activate the spark. It's just a one cigarette lighter, and that's not going to weigh anyone down."
56.62700000000001,75.46100000000001,R,"Aye, that's a point. Very lightweight, yeah. So would you reckon... Also, I mean, yeah, I suppose maybe Yeah, just for the sheer fact that it's very lightweight and whatever, then maybe we should actually put yes on that. Your point about the spark is actually quite good."
75.481,75.62200000000001,C,Okay.
75.642,76.62200000000001,R,Presuming it has a battery.
77.38300000000004,78.36400000000003,C,"Right, go for yes then?"
78.44400000000002,79.60500000000002,R,"Okay, yeah, go for yes then."
