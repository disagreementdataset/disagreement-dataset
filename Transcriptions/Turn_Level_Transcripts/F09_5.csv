4.673000000000002,14.001999999999995,R,"Yeah, I'll put yes for that, because you know the mad thing about you here, like people sleeping under newspapers on park benches and stuff, is that actually a thing, or is that just something you see in cartoons?"
14.503,33.620000000000005,C,"No, I mean I think you're probably right, I think that some people probably do do it, but the only reason I actually thought that I wasn't going to focus so much on the overnight survival was the fact that it is only 20 miles away, and if they were able to make good time, there's a chance that they could do it in one day. that they wouldn't need to sleep there all night and things like that. No, that was just some of my logic on it anyway."
33.74000000000001,35.760999999999996,R,"But then do a gamble on that, that's the question, isn't it?"
36.081999999999994,41.92599999999999,C,"Yeah, well, that's it. It's a bit of a gamble, especially when it's minus 40 at night. I thought the best thing you could do is stay light and try and get home as fast as possible."
43.96799999999999,44.928,R,"Yeah, probably is the best."
48.519000000000005,60.14699999999999,C,"I kind of tried to work out what the things would be really necessary first and then kind of work back, but I know that we've got to go in the order of top to bottom. But I did say no to newspapers, but it's up to you. I mean, we can obviously go yes or no. Which would you prefer?"
60.206999999999994,89.274,R,"Well, it's got the dual function of the fire and... And potentially what? I don't know. As you say, you could probably get back... Well, I don't know, because I was thinking lighters coming up. I was thinking that... Like if you can get sparks off that, you could light the... That's right from the front, yeah. You could light the newspaper in that, but I don't know if there's snow on the ground, the twigs might be damp, so I don't know if you can... Well, we're definitely hot in the winter. Yeah, so, do you want to say yes to the newspaper?"
90.055,90.23500000000001,C,Sure.
90.79499999999999,91.035,R,Okay.
91.416,92.01599999999999,C,Let's go for that then.
