0.0,5.783999999999992,R,six is a cigarette lighter without fluid. So what are your thoughts?
5.824000000000069,13.028999999999996,C,"Well, if it doesn't have fluid, obviously that immediately reduces its usefulness, but I suppose you could still use it to make a spark, I guess."
14.336999999999989,20.0,R,"I'm not a smoker, so I'm happy to defer here from the point of view of sparks from cigarette lighters."
20.82000000000005,29.94500000000005,C,"I mean, I don't know how big they would be. It depends, I guess, on the type of lighter. I'm not a smoker, but there are several heavy smokers in my family."
31.024999999999977,39.349000000000046,R,"So I guess the question is, if you didn't have a used-up cigarette lighter, how would you go about creating a fire?"
40.33100000000002,40.95100000000002,C,"Yes, I suppose."
41.13099999999997,52.83400000000006,R,"We're going to have to bang two rocks together. So, I guess it comes down to, do you think we could start a fire without one?"
55.93399999999997,60.65499999999997,C,"I don't know. I suppose on business suits, how much woodcraft do we think they have?"
64.08600000000001,68.48700000000008,R,"Yeah, thinking about it, I'm not entirely sure I could start one with a cigarette lighter."
69.10800000000006,69.34800000000007,UNKNOWN,Yeah.
69.90800000000002,97.95299999999997,R,"Without flame. So initially I thought no for this one because I didn't think it would be particularly useful over, you know, just banging two stones together or having wood together, whatever. I suppose, I mean, survival really will depend on them keeping warm, so. Yeah. A fire's an important thing, but Will they be able to start a fire with a used up cigarette lighter?"
100.09400000000005,111.43900000000008,C,"I don't know, it just depends on what fuel they have access to and how dry it is, I guess. If it's just getting a tiny spark off a cigarette lighter, it's not going to go that far. So I think I can probably be convinced that that's maybe not essential."
112.96000000000004,126.75800000000004,R,"OK, I think the same thing. So that's... That would go with what I was thinking. MC happy with that, eh? A no for that?"
127.678,128.57900000000006,C,"Eh, okay, I'll do that."
135.78200000000004,135.92200000000003,UNKNOWN,"So,"
