4.5020000000000095,16.595000000000027,R,"I said yes too, but I'm not exactly sure what they mean by air map, I don't know what that means. Is it going to be useful to people on the ground to navigate with?"
19.876000000000033,28.59899999999999,C,"Yeah, that's a good point. I originally put yes, but as you said, I don't think that's going to be much use to a whole lot of people."
29.939999999999998,39.28300000000007,R,"I've put yes too, but I'm not sure about it. I just think at the end of the day you'd be kind of crazy if you lost to not bring a map with you."
40.492999999999995,63.166,C,"Yeah, although, I'm trying to have a look at it, it doesn't really look like there's anything you can tell from it. A name app wouldn't have land coverage on it, would it? I don't know. Shall we say yes anyway, considering we both said yes and we're not sure?"
63.825999999999965,77.89100000000002,R,"Yeah, I think that they should take a map. I'd hope that it would at least have things like rivers marked on it and forests marked on it, so they could know hills and stuff. I just don't know what sort of information's on here, Matt."
78.81099999999998,82.85300000000001,C,"That's true. Okay,"
