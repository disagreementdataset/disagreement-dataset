0.0,1.6020000000000323,C,I've got a yes for the GT canvas.
1.9020000000000437,8.227000000000032,R,So do I. It's quite big but I think that would be important for the many potential high numbers of people.
10.51600000000002,14.057000000000016,C,"We don't know how many folks there are, so we're not restricted in that way in some senses."
14.076999999999998,19.418000000000006,R,"It would be important for a shelter of some sort as well, and it would probably burn if they needed it to."
20.399,33.781000000000006,C,"I'm not sure if the plastic would be well. The only thing I could think against it was, I suppose it would protect against if there was rain or snow to keep them a bit drier, but it wouldn't actually protect from the cold very much, would it?"
33.84100000000001,39.367999999999995,R,"I think it would, because it's a... It's kind of like a tarpaulin sort of thing, you know, like you get on from a tent."
39.38900000000001,41.269000000000005,C,"It does say heavy duty, doesn't it? Mm-hmm."
41.56999999999999,44.15100000000001,R,I think it would probably be quite insulated. I don't know. Okay.
44.17099999999999,47.513000000000034,C,"So yes or no? That is better than on the snow anyway. Yeah, yeah, certainly."
47.97300000000001,48.992999999999995,R,"Okay, so yes for that one as well?"
49.374000000000024,50.53399999999999,C,Yep. Cool.
