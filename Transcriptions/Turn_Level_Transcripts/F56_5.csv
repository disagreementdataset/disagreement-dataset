6.724000000000004,21.343000000000004,R,"Well, the reason I said yes is newspapers are a really good insulator. If you wrap yourself in newspaper it keeps heat in very well. so it'd be something that they could all use to wrap themselves in for extra heat if it's cold."
22.68400000000001,27.988000000000014,C,"Yeah, I guess it's also, it's covered in snow and it's wet, won't the newspaper just kind of get soggy?"

51.980000000000004,52.521,R,"Okay, good."
