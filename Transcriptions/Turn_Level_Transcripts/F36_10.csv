25.177999999999997,38.92500000000007,R,"I think, I put yes for this because I thought, I mean whisky, I mean they have like the St Bernard rescue dogs taking brandy up into the hills for people to keep them warm, I mean it's gonna, you know, if they all have a wee nip of whisky it's gonna help keep them warm overnight."
39.325000000000045,69.46500000000003,C,"Well the thing is, it's, that's really a bit of a fallacy because it doesn't, it doesn't, although it'll make you feel warm inside, it'll actually lower your body temperature. It's really giving you a false sense of heat. Right, okay.

82.51400000000001,87.35800000000006,R,If you're telling me it's not going to keep people warm then there's no point. It's quite heavy.
87.61900000000003,102.55200000000002,C,"No, if you drink it, it will give you a warm feeling inside. But your actual body temperature will still be getting lower because of the cold. So we're agreeing a no for that."
102.952,103.89300000000003,R,"Yeah, we'll say no for that."
104.63300000000004,106.17600000000004,C,"Okay, right,"
