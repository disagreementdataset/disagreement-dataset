16.813999999999993,41.685,R,"I thought no, Jane, but we can't go back and change it now anyway. I was wondering whether it was included to use as fat with this steel wool, because apparently steel wool, if it's fine, is quite flammable. So as opposed to actually using it for energy, I thought they might be using it for a torch or a flame or something like this. But I put no, because it's obviously a heavy thing to carry and you don't need it. So I'm with you in no. I'm quite happy with knowing that as well."
