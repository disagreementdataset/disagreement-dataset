3.841000000000008,7.204000000000008,R,"I don't know, what could you do with cigarette lighter when it's not got fluid?"
7.4839999999999804,11.627999999999986,C,"Yeah, I don't, because I don't think it even... Does it still spark?"
12.688999999999965,13.408999999999992,R,I don't think so.
13.829999999999984,14.70999999999998,C,I don't think it does.
15.370999999999981,17.272999999999968,R,"You can throw it and it sparks, actually."

34.50200000000001,35.06299999999999,R,Would that work?
35.722999999999956,57.22999999999996,C,"Well, alcohol lights, but... Oh, it's quite a good idea. Because it does seem weird that it's on the list if it's just not even going to... Yeah, probably. Like, it's as if... Oh, I think we should say yes. And a cigarette lighter you can put in your pocket. It's not like it's going to affect anyone. Yeah, let's take it. I think it's better to take it than not."
58.089999999999975,58.65100000000001,R,"Yeah, let's see."
