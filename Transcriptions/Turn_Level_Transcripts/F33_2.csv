3.3830000000000027,4.7840000000000025,C,I thought maybe they could use it to chop wood.
6.065000000000001,16.288000000000004,R,"Yeah, I thought that as well, but... they won't have anything to light the wood with, so... Unless you all take a newspaper."
19.230000000000004,26.974000000000004,C,And does the cigarette lighter create a spark? In the same way flint does? Was my thinking.
27.755000000000003,31.737000000000002,R,"I'm not sure, I wasn't sure because it said without fluid. Yeah."
32.898,38.599000000000004,C,But presumably what a cigarette lighter does is creates a spark which lights the fluid.
40.199000000000005,44.38100000000001,R,"Okay, so do you think it would be good to take the small wax then?"
45.142,49.202999999999996,C,I don't know. I suppose they could just find wood lying around. It's quite a heavy thing to take.
50.163999999999994,72.75300000000001,R,"Yeah, I thought that as well. I thought if they found like fallen branches or maybe just like big branches that had maybe fallen off the tree because we've got to think about how much they're going to be carrying as a whole so I don't think that they would need the small axe but what do you think?"
73.773,83.957,C,I wasn't sure because of the way I ticked it but I'm happy to change my mind on that one okay so should we should we say no for that one as well okay okay
