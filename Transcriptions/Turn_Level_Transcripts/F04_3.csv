First one is, you're in Northern Canada, up in the wilderness, and I know that there are grizzly bears and the like around there, so in some sort of sense of defence. But in second point, what I know can be done is that you're Because they have the axe, or I thought we should take the axe with us, you can actually separate out the bullets to get the gunpowder and you can use that to ignite fires and things."
32.469999999999985,56.54600000000001,C,"Ah, that's good thinking actually, I hadn't thought of that because I'd actually said no to the pistol because I hear what you're saying about the grizzly bears, but I thought with a large group of people I'd actually be able to scare off any wild animals, but I hadn't thought about using the gunpowder.
