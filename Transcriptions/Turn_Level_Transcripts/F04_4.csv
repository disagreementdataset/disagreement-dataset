0.0,1.4010000000000105,C,How about the can of butter?
4.081999999999994,5.722000000000008,R,So I'll let you go first on this one.
5.782000000000011,23.655,C,"Okay, well my view on this was that they should take it with them and the reason I was thinking that was something like butter is going to have a high fat content and a high calorie content so it's going to be something that is not going to be particularly pleasant to eat, it's something that would actually keep them going. should they find themselves in a position where they're really struggling for food?"
24.955000000000013,51.471000000000004,R,"Right, yes. So I actually put no on this for the can of butter, but I'll be honest, I was a little bit undecided. Again, I was trying to factor in the duration of time that they might be out there for. So again, I was thinking maybe if it's just eight hours, they could get by with some other foodstuffs later on. I don't know. I'm undecided on that one, to be honest."
52.512,88.35400000000001,C,"Well, my thinking there, in terms of coming back to what you said about the length of time they're going to be out there for, like you say, a 20-mile walk, it's not going to take very long. Eight hours sounds reasonable when you consider, say, if you were going to be doing it in Glasgow on a day like we have here, but given that it's minus 25 and they are in the wilderness and they've got several rivers that they have to cross, I think it's probably going to take them longer than the eight hours they may find themselves in a situation where they need to be eating something to keep their energy levels up. And that was really why I was going with the butter on that one."
89.61500000000001,115.22000000000003,R,"Yes, okay. I do see your point. The other reason I was thinking that it may have been a potential candidate was I thought perhaps if you're trying to get a fire going, again, depending on how greasy your butter is, you might be able to use it as a catalyst okay okay yeah I agree I'm going to change my I'm going to say take the butter with them okay fair enough"
