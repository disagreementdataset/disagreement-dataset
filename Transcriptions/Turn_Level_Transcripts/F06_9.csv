0.0,7.963999999999942,R,"The map. So, looking at the map I'm seeing here on the screen, it looks like a pretty pointless map as far as 20 miles is concerned."
8.384000000000015,10.085000000000036,C,Have you got a screen rather than a piece of paper?
10.54600000000005,18.889999999999986,R,"Well, no, I'm looking at the piece of paper but I've got a tiny view of an air and an air map is going to be on a scale that's going to be pretty useless for travel on ground."
20.890999999999963,35.960000000000036,C,"I'm not so sure about that. I'm not sure, I mean, telling people to leave behind the only map they have, even if it's just as a reassuring comfort blanket, I'd be tempted to take it, because it's better than nothing."
36.730999999999995,59.35299999999995,R,"I wasn't totally sure on what their location is. They said they're 20 miles away. I presume they know roughly where they are, where the plane went down. The map is going to be small and light. You're right, you're supposed to have a map, but that map, if it's the one I'm seeing here in front of me, may be pretty useless to them."
60.11299999999994,70.31700000000001,C,"I can't see anything. I can't judge the quality of the map from the photo, so I would say take it because I can't make that call. Maybe you've got a better picture than me."
70.53700000000003,89.50300000000004,R,"I would be, from experience, I'd agree with you. Not having a map is pretty bad news, but in comparison, having a map that's completely the wrong scale is pretty useless. But I'll agree with you on account of we don't really know what type of map they've got. So, shall we agree to take that one?"
90.07799999999997,93.0,C,"Yeah, because I think it might be reassuring as well for someone to be arrogant."
93.03999999999996,96.322,R,Absolutely. Psychological advantage.
96.74199999999996,97.44299999999998,C,Motivational.
98.48400000000004,99.00400000000002,R,Absolutely.
