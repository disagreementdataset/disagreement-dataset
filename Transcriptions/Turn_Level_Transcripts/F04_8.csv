And I take your point you said earlier on about, OK, it's most likely going to be longer than eight hours, and I do agree. but perhaps they could still do it in a day. And I was thinking, if you could get away without having to carry that, because, you know, it's saying the lighter, or rather the less things you take, the better. So I was thinking, if you can ditch the heavy-duty canvas, because you've now got your newspaper to shove in to ditch windchill, and you've got extra clothing, and you can huddle together for warmth, and you'll have a fire. And the heavy-duty canvas, I was thinking, would really just be to ditch the wind."
