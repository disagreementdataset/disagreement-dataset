0.0,5.665999999999997,R,so two down and number three. So a loaded .45 caliber pistol. So what are your feelings on this one?
8.027999999999963,18.428999999999974,C,"Well, this is where I was thinking about the protection. I don't know how many animals are out and about at that kind of temperature, but if they are, might be good to have the gun?"
20.46999999999997,28.415999999999997,R,"Yeah, so I guess part of the problem is not being from Northern Canada and we don't know really what the dangers are out there."
28.93599999999998,29.415999999999997,C,"Yeah, true."
30.757000000000005,42.424999999999955,R,"So I mean, do you get things like, well presumably you get things like wolves, but things like polar bears, were they more kind of greeling than Northern Canada?"
43.49399999999997,55.041,C,"Yeah, I kind of imagined they would be up there, but again, I don't know enough about the area to say for sure, but I would have sort of imagined that it would be some kind of bears or wolves or some cats or whatever, like mountain lions."
55.42099999999999,77.88899999999995,R,"So, for the first one I'd said no, because I was expecting running around with a small hat. defending myself that way. Yeah, I'd do both because I don't trust myself with an axe to be honest. Yeah, but I can certainly see situations where the pistol would come in handy."
78.44899999999996,79.52999999999997,C,Yeah.
80.84999999999997,124.56899999999996,R,"And it's, I guess it's small and relatively light. So from the point of view of survival, I guess I guess it would be handy to have. I don't know whether it would be an essential, but I guess there are situations where it may be useful, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So, are you thinking yes, then? I said yes, but I mean... This is one I'm willing to be persuaded on. I was swithering this one. Yeah. Because, as I say, I wasn't quite sure of the conditions. But, as you say, I think there are situations you can imagine it would come in very, very useful."
125.12899999999996,127.45099999999996,C,Yeah. So we go for that with a yes as well then?
127.471,129.05199999999996,R,I agree with a yes there.
129.512,129.95299999999997,C,Perfect. Okay. So
