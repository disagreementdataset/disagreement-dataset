0.0,15.810999999999993,C,"As regards to a small axe, I said no, but now that I've had a second thought on it, it might have come in useful for chopping some firewood."
16.411,52.82599999999999,R,"Yeah. I said no, but I also thought about that. If they're 20 miles away from the nearest town, I suppose they are going to have to take a break at some point. I guess you couldn't walk 20 miles. I'm just thinking, sort of later on, it seems to be that there are newspapers and a cigarette lighter, and that might be able to start a fire, and a small axe might not be necessary."
53.275999999999996,74.901,C,"Well, I mean, I think it would only be two requirements for a Small Axe, and that would be to chop firewood and maybe for protection. But, you know, I had looked further down the list, and I thought that a loaded .45 caliber pistol would be more sufficient."
75.38099999999999,76.341,R,Sure.
76.361,80.222,C,"So, do you want to agree or no on the Small Axe?"
80.89299999999999,87.33800000000001,R,"Well, I think so. I've said no to the loaded .45 caliber pistol as well. Maybe we can talk about that when we get to it."
87.498,87.79799999999999,C,Okay.
88.639,90.08,R,"Yep, we say no for a small axe."
90.38000000000001,90.72099999999999,C,"Okay,"
