0.0,16.41700000000003,R,so next item is a small axe yeah I considered perhaps possibly but then decided against it on on account of the fact that if they're not planning to stay around they won't need to chop wood and likewise it's quite a heavy item to be carrying
17.602000000000032,33.733000000000004,C,"Well yeah, the reason I said yes is because I was assuming that they were going to have to start a fire at some point somewhere. If not, the only reason I can see again is for chopping branches down to aid river crossings. Depends on how deep the rivers are going to be."
34.35300000000001,51.46500000000003,R,"Exactly. I think if they need to chop branches down to cross that river, they're probably trying to cross it in the wrong location. They'd need to move somewhere else to cross it. It's not going to help them massively. They'd probably be able to find bits of wood nearby."
51.485000000000014,58.190000000000055,C,"Okay, in that case, let's go with a no, because we could probably improvise, I guess."
58.650000000000034,58.85000000000002,R,Yeah.
59.39100000000002,61.932000000000016,C,It just depends on what the punishment is. Okay.
