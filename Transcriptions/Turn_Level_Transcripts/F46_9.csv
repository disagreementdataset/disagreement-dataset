I put no down because I said, are they in contact? And he said, well, how did they make this call? I said, it doesn't say anything about phones. So I was worried about how they were going to set out. He said, well, they've got a radio, presumably in the plane to start with. So I thought if they had spoken to the SOS team, maybe they'd got some initial stuff like go to a river and follow the river northwest or something so I was thinking that it would be of limited use because the detail was low okay except for starting off or it's only 20 miles so if it's a small scale is it much use what did you put down first"
