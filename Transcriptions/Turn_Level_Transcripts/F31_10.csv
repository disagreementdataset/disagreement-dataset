0.0,6.786000000000001,C,"So your rescue, I've actually got no written down, but the only thing I can think of is for wounds and for cleaning the wounds."
7.265999999999963,8.34699999999998,R,"Oh yeah, I suppose so, yeah."
8.366999999999962,12.289999999999964,C,"It just says they're survivors, it doesn't say if they're injured or not."
12.970999999999947,14.47199999999998,R,"So yeah, that would be quite useful."
14.512,26.528999999999996,C,"But even you could get injured as you're going, but I mean, again, maybe... Maybe that's an excessive thing to carry for it, and maybe it puts in the temptation of someone actually drinking it as well, which is not good for their hydration."
26.82899999999995,33.99799999999999,R,"It's hard to know if it's... I mean, it's probably quite flammable. I don't know, it's not..."
36.27699999999999,39.19900000000001,C,I think it depends how much percentage it is and things.
41.041,60.07699999999994,R,I'm not sure if that's one for the movies or what. I don't know. I'm presuming it's in a glass bottle as well so that'd be quite heavy. I've got no as well if you want to stick with that one. I get the feeling it's a bit of a wild card though.
62.23499999999996,64.31599999999997,C,"I suppose it does, yeah."
64.35599999999994,75.12399999999997,R,"I know they used to give people whisky or brandy and things like that to try and keep them warm, but I think that's actually not done anymore because it doesn't really do that. Yeah, it's great."
75.14399999999995,85.38999999999993,C,"It actually cools people down, I think. It thins the blood, so it stops that. But we've both got no, anyway, unless we can, I think, maybe just go for that."
85.791,86.19099999999997,R,Still no?
