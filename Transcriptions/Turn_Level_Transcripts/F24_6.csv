0.0,23.91300000000001,C,"Okay, the next item is the cigarette lighter without the fluid. I don't smoke, so I'm not very familiar with lighters, but I thought even without the fluid, it still has the ability to create a kind of spark, doesn't it, with things rubbing off? And I thought that could be potentially useful if they did need to make a fire, because sometimes, I think, I mean, I put yes for that one."
24.873000000000047,38.87800000000004,R,"Right, I had put no for that one, because I was thinking, and without fluid. I was also wondering about the availability, if there's snow in the ground, about getting dry wood. I'm not terribly familiar with countryside."
39.43900000000002,40.23900000000003,C,"No, me neither."
41.44,56.83200000000005,R,"But I had wondered if it's without fluid, it would probably run out fairly quickly. And if they couldn't find dry wood to light,"
60.77600000000001,70.48500000000001,C,The ground might not be dry enough even if they could work without fluid. Maybe we should say no to that one then.
70.58500000000004,80.79500000000002,R,I'm willing to be convinced because I was hesitant about that one. I can see that for the creation of heat
82.15200000000004,97.64300000000003,C,I hadn't really thought about the aspect that it's so damp out and about. Because when it's warm and dry then sometimes even a spark can be enough to create a fire but not in damp. So we'll say no to that one.
97.66300000000001,100.90500000000003,R,We'll say no and rely for heat on other things.
