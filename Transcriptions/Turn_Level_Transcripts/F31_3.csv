0.0,8.066000000000003,C,"Pistol? Yeah, I thought so. More for, like, alerting people to that they're there. Okay, yeah."
8.085999999999999,9.888000000000005,R,"I feel so, yeah, I've thought about that."
10.228000000000009,20.576999999999998,C,"Yeah, initially I'd kind of thought about animals and that being Northern Canada, but I think a pistol is not going to be much use against a bear anyway, or something. Yeah, and it is loaded. You may get a raccoon with it or something, but I mean, that's not going to be much danger anyway."
21.057000000000002,21.878,R,"Yeah, that's true."
22.438000000000002,22.97800000000001,C,Okay.
23.13900000000001,33.543000000000006,R,"What do you think? I don't know, I'd sort of said no, but maybe in terms of alerting people, that might be Although they are known to... Yeah, maybe to the... Okay, I don't know."
34.022999999999996,48.977000000000004,C,"You know, like if there's somebody that's... Yeah, if they see someone that's nearby or such like, then I don't know, it'd be one of the only ways they could maybe make a big enough noise, unless they could start up a flame. That was my only thought with it."
49.93700000000001,60.82599999999999,R,"Okay, I don't know. I'm sort of... I can understand where you're coming from with that one. I don't know if it's probably not that heavy. I suppose it would... I don't know if it would be legal to have one."
62.144000000000005,75.40700000000001,C,"I think that wouldn't matter too much to them if they're in a surrounding situation, the laws are going to go out the window a little bit. Are you persuaded, or are you thinking not?"
76.24799999999999,101.38,R,"I'm just thinking about the number of items they need to take, because there are quite a few later on that I think will... they'd be quite important as well, and I don't know about... Yeah, there's no limit to the number of items, though, is there? I suppose if they're getting rescued to occur, then, and increasing their chances of survival, I suppose, by being able to alert people, that would be quite a good way of increasing their chances of being rescued, so... Yeah. I'm up for saying yeah for that one, I think. OK."
102.06,104.981,C,"We don't have a limit to the amount of stuff we can carry, though, do we?"
105.02100000000002,108.18299999999999,R,"No, but if anyone went over, I think it's sort of... Yeah."
108.303,109.12299999999999,C,That's great.
109.56300000000002,110.60400000000001,R,"OK, we'll go with yes for that one."
111.275,111.715,C,"Okay, cool."
