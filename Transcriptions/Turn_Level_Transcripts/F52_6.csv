0.0,2.3210000000000264,C,Cigarette lighter. So this is just a means of producing a spark.
2.7620000000000005,3.022000000000048,R,Yeah.
3.7420000000000186,23.855999999999995,C,"But we've already got the gun as well. Yeah. Although with the gun I'm not sure it helps produce a spark as such, does it? Because you've got the gunpowder if you can extract it. If you can extract it. But by firing it I don't think it's going to light a fire, but this is getting a bit technical."
24.434000000000026,32.97700000000003,R,"Yeah, and the gun was for... the priority for the gun was for protection, yeah. Okay, so it still produces a spark."
34.05800000000005,50.363999999999976,C,"Yeah, because, I mean, in a way, because you've got three things to think about, haven't you? You've got staying warm and staying fed in the very short term, then you've got to think about if you have to spend the night somewhere, which is bad news, it's minus 40. I mean, to be honest, with what they've got at minus 40, I think they're probably going to die, to be honest."
50.464,59.14299999999997,R,"Yeah, I know, they probably will. In minus 40, would the fire even stay lit? I mean, I'm not a scientist in any way, shape or form."
59.16300000000007,81.03699999999998,C,"Yeah, I think it would, if you could get it lit. The only thing, because I mean, the priority obviously would be to get it out there as soon as possible, because they haven't got much in the way of clothes or food. Yeah, so fire would draw attention to it. So in a way, if you're going to survive a night, I guess you've got to have fire. Yeah, and also draw attention. And even now it's touch and go, isn't it? Which is why... Is it a signal?"
81.60700000000003,82.988,R,a signal for where they are as well.
83.38799999999998,87.71200000000005,C,"Yeah, oh, that's true. Oh, that's very, I didn't know if you thought of that. Yes, of course. So should we say yes to that?"
88.05200000000008,88.25200000000001,UNKNOWN,Yes.
88.93300000000005,91.25500000000005,C,"Three, take the lot, take the whole thing."
