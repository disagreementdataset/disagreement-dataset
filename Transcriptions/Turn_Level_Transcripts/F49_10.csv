0.4810000000000514,2.5820000000000505,C,I said no for the whisky.
4.080000000000041,58.48000000000002,R,"I said no as well, but thinking about it now actually, if we're going to have a fire, as opposed to drinking it, if you put the whisky on the newspaper or some of the wood to help it burn...

So I'm going to change from no to yes. How do you feel about that?"
