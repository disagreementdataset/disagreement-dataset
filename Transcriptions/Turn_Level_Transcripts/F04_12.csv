And the reason I have said no to the chocolate is because I think that it gives you a, it's high in sugar. It's going to give you a very brief energy spike, but it's not really going to do you much more good than that. Though, to be honest, I'm prepared to be persuaded otherwise."

I know for a fact that the mountain rescue teams always carry chocolate with them because, for the very reason, it does give you an instantaneous, or short-term, boost in energy, which can sometimes be really what you need. For that particular example, we're going to make camp tonight, but I'm feeling a bit low, but we're not going to stop to make food, so I'll just have this to get me through this next wee bit. Right, fair enough. I thought in particular when they were saying, you know, we have to cross rivers and things like that, you might want a little pick-me-up just before you head off to do something like that, and although it contains sugar and eventually you will drop on the other side of it, it does give that kind of short-term And if it's not so, you know, say it takes hours to do, they need some sort of sustenance with them. So I put yes for that."
