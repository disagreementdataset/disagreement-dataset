11.728999999999985,38.31899999999996,R,"I thought, well I thought yes at first because whisky is supposed to, there's this old kind of myth that you drink whisky and you keep warm. But I think that's just like a, I think it's a myth, you know how they tell you that it's your body thinking that you're, like that's the whole thing with alcohol, your body thinks that you're warm but it's actually, it decreases your temperature.

80.75200000000001,81.97299999999996,C,"It's quite a lot, isn't it?"
83.154,86.19599999999997,R,"But a lot of whisky's as good as a little, so let's just go with yes."
