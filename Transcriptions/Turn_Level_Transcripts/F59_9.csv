0.0,1.3600000000000136,R,what did you say about the air map
2.319000000000017,6.701000000000022,C,"I said yes, but I don't really know enough about how useful it would be."
7.8209999999999695,29.20999999999998,R,"So I said no, because if they don't really know where they are on the map, then the map's not going to be useful. Because if they've just crash-landed, they won't know where they are. Yeah, I kind of thought maybe that would be the case as well. If it's just a case of picking stuff that you do just need, I just think it wouldn't be so useful."
29.889999999999986,31.851,C,"Okay, I'll go with that and say no."
