0.0,1.0010000000000048,R,"whiskey, I said no to."
2.1599999999999966,3.3610000000000184,C,I said yes to the whiskey.
4.322000000000003,6.664000000000016,R,"Okay, but why did you say yes?"
7.844999999999999,19.55600000000001,C,"I guess it's kind of similar to the butter thing. It's the only liquid they have. I guess the whiskey's not that hydrating. That's true, yeah. If it gets really bad, they can just down it."
20.43300000000002,20.992999999999995,UNKNOWN,"It is, yes."
21.714,29.739000000000033,R,"Numb their pain a bit. Well, the reason I said no to the whisky was because whisky alcohol can make you colder because it restricts the blood vessels."
30.13900000000001,30.69999999999999,C,That's true.
30.980000000000018,45.049000000000035,R,"So it stops blood flow to your extremities. And I thought for water, if there's flowing rivers about, that should maybe be fresh water. Or even melted snow might be enough hydration for them."
45.610000000000014,50.648000000000025,C,"Yeah, I definitely agree. Yeah, the whisky's not that practical, is it?"
51.388000000000034,54.351,R,"Okay, good. It's probably quite heavy if it's a glass bowl of whisky."
54.87099999999998,55.672000000000025,C,"Yeah, definitely."
