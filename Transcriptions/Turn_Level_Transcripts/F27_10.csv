0.0,11.82400000000007,C,Right. Whiskey. I said yes for this because the alcohol would be flammable so the spark could be helpful with that.
14.325000000000045,17.98599999999999,R,Not a bad idea. I was just thinking of whiskey. You drink it to kind of keep you warm.
18.686000000000035,20.887000000000057,C,"Oh, okay. Did you write yes as well?"
21.147000000000048,32.829000000000065,R,"No, I put no but I kind of thought, well, I've seen the benefits of it, but I'm not sure if it's entirely necessary. I mean, it's going to be pretty heavy to carry about."
33.389999999999986,34.67100000000005,C,"That is true, that is true."
36.27200000000005,43.357000000000085,R,"Because if we've got the lighter, and we can... I mean, you could always start a fire and stuff, like, from stones or whatever."
43.75700000000006,54.524,C,"Yeah, that is true, that is true. And then, also, if you're going to drink it to keep warm, if there's, like, seven of you, like, there's not really enough whiskey to get everybody pissed. So, like..."
55.825000000000045,60.94799999999998,R,"To me, it's probably more of a luxury. I don't think it's a necessity."
61.569000000000074,80.36000000000001,C,"See, I did initially put down no, and then at the start of the phone call, I was like, oh. It obviously just rolled into place that you could be able to light it with a cigarette lighter. But my initial feeling was no, but then I thought, oh, well, maybe. I'm not bothered about carrying it, to be honest."
80.38,85.77800000000002,R,"No, I think it's quite heavy. The uses of it we can get round with other ways, in other ways."
86.519,86.83900000000006,C,"Oh, okay."
87.399,92.64300000000003,R,"It'd be better that they don't go swimming the river's pished. Yeah, okay, yeah."
93.12300000000005,95.10500000000002,C,"Okay, and what about a compass? What did you say for that?"
95.125,98.12700000000007,R,"Right, so that was a no. Yeah, so I didn't write it down."
98.16700000000003,98.327,C,"Yeah,"
