0.0,4.802999999999997,C,"Okay, so number six is a cigarette lighter without fluid."
6.7239999999999895,7.704999999999984,R,For that one I put yes.
8.96999999999997,13.572999999999979,C,I put no because it didn't have the fluid in it.
14.913999999999987,25.182000000000016,R,"I put yes because before I thought of the axe being used as a flint. Although there's no fluid in it, it produces very easily sparks."
26.463000000000022,29.545000000000016,C,"Yeah, I suppose now that we've got the axe."
31.002999999999986,38.12700000000001,R,"Well, yeah, but you need to find a good piece of flint to hit the axe off of, which could be difficult. Oh, there's a plane crash, there's metal everywhere."
38.66699999999997,43.76999999999998,C,"Yeah, I suppose the axe is multifunctional anyway, so I wouldn't necessarily... yeah."
44.69,49.81299999999999,R,"It would just be easier, I just thought it would be easier for the sparks, and plus it weighs next to nothing."
49.83299999999997,60.238999999999976,C,"Yeah, it doesn't take up much room anyway, so... Yeah, let's go for yes for that one then. So, yes for the cigarette lighter."
60.817999999999984,61.519000000000005,R,"Yep, number six."
62.15899999999999,62.59899999999999,C,"Yep, yes."
