0.0,3.380999999999972,C,"that. Right, your turn I think."
3.4809999999999945,14.785999999999945,R,"I said compass, no. Because the map would be enough to tell you where you are, you don't really know what direction you're going, because you're not going anywhere really."
16.531999999999925,20.913999999999987,C,"Okay, I'd say yes. I'd favour the compass over the map."
25.15599999999995,41.524,R,"See, I think a compass is only useful if you have a map, really. Well, just from my opinion, because it's all well and good knowing that you're going north, south, east or west, but if you don't know what's there... Yeah."
47.09699999999998,69.90999999999997,C,"I'm just going back again. Why did you think that a compass would work? Well, I thought that, just in general, if they had a compass at least they'd travel in the same direction, they wouldn't go around in circles."
72.52199999999993,75.12399999999991,R,Was your idea that they would travel back to the town?
75.26400000000001,77.62599999999998,C,"Well, I thought they would start travelling at least."
78.28599999999994,78.50599999999997,R,Right.
79.86699999999996,85.85199999999998,C,"But maybe not. If your idea of them being helicoptered out, that's fine."
85.89199999999994,93.93700000000001,R,"Well, my only thing about them starting travelling is the difference that they would make by starting to travel wouldn't really make a difference if you've got a helicopter."
94.57799999999997,98.46100000000001,C,"No. Very true. Okay, well, I'll knock the compass off."
100.05399999999997,101.71499999999992,R,I don't want to keep changing my answer.
101.755,112.298,C,"No, no, no, I mean, what you're saying makes perfect sense. I think because you approached it from a different way because you're thinking helicopters and I was thinking of trudging 20 miles through snow."
112.31799999999998,120.84100000000001,R,"Yeah, because I started thinking that. And then I thought, well, then I realised that we were a rescue team, so we can't rescue them."
123.24199999999996,125.12299999999993,C,"Very true. Right, I'm persuaded."
