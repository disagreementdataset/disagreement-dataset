0.0,1.3610000000001037,C,What do we want to do with the whiskey?
2.081000000000131,11.548999999999978,R,"See, that's another hard one because it's heavy. I mean, if they've got the newspapers to make fire, do they need the whiskey as well?"
12.789999999999964,18.814000000000078,C,"I don't think they want the whiskey. I think it's... I mean, I don't know how... Do you have any idea what a quart is?"
18.83400000000006,27.819999999999936,R,"A quart, I think that's like a quarter gallon, so that'd be about 750 ml."
28.621000000000095,38.587999999999965,C,"Right, so it's a normal, standard-sized bottle of whiskey. I mean, the only thing that it's useful for, really, is disinfecting wounds."
39.048,50.177000000000135,R,"Disinfecting wounds, yeah. setting something on fire, but we've got to use people for that, and if they've got infected wounds within the first hour or the first day, then... Yeah."
50.277000000000044,54.499000000000024,C,Yeah. Hopefully they're going to reach civilisation before that. So we're going to say no on that one?
54.840000000000146,56.221000000000004,R,"Yeah, say no on that one. Okay."
