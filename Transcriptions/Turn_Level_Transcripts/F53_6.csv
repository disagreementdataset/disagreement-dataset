0.0,7.862999999999943,C,"Okay, cigarette lighter. I put yes for this, because, I mean, obviously it's got no fluid, but spark would be really useful for..."
12.933999999999969,43.30899999999997,R,"Well, it's from my head. Discussing what we should do, I wondered if whiskey could be started, could be ignited. Whiskey is quite flammable. Whiskey is quite flammable. It would burn easily. Whether you were bashing two rocks together. Even if you get a spark, if you could make a spark, with the axe on a stone even."
43.92999999999995,44.16999999999996,C,Yeah.
44.18999999999994,55.519000000000005,R,"A spark would maybe start, you know, you might be able to lockstart a newspaper, but anything will burn more easily with whisky."
56.379999999999995,56.67999999999995,C,Yeah.
56.69999999999993,94.9899999999999,R,"You know, you see people in a restaurant thumping or on the television, you know, putting, you know, yeah, spit it into a frying pan kind of thing and it just goes whoosh. So. But then having said that, I suppose the question is, what's the method for starting the fire? I suppose that is, it would be talking about a spark, or would the cigarette lighter be, and would, if you haven't got the fluid. Would whisky work in it, or would it be better just thinking with the axe on stone?"
95.45099999999991,122.35900000000004,C,"I think it's probably quite difficult to just start a spark with the axe, especially with it being so cold and stuff. I don't know how easy it actually is to do that, especially if you're trying to start a fire and do it repeatedly. It probably makes sense to take that, just for the fact that even though it doesn't have the fluid in it, you'll have a spark that you can use, and you can do over and over again, which means it's much more likely that you're going to be able to start a fire successfully. Yeah. The sort of sparks you get off an axe, which are sort of less directed as well."
125.97899999999993,126.17999999999995,UNKNOWN,Yeah.
127.15999999999997,128.77999999999986,R,"I'll go with that. You think we should take it, then?"
129.34000000000003,130.17999999999995,C,"I think we should, yeah."
130.67999999999995,132.42099999999994,R,"Okay. I'll go with that as well, then. Okay."
132.62099999999998,133.26099999999985,C,"Right, we'll put yours on."
133.80100000000004,133.90099999999995,UNKNOWN,Yeah.
