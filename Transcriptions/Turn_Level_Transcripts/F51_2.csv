0.0,2.4609999999999985,C,"Um, the small axe, I'm reckoning yes."
3.640999999999991,12.683999999999983,R,"What would be the merits in taking the small axe? Um, chopping down wood to make a fire. Right, how would we make a fire?"
14.105000000000004,20.106999999999985,C,"Well, I'm saying yes to the cigarette lighter. Oh, right, okay, I just realised that's without fluid. Yeah. Okay."
20.50699999999999,42.36200000000001,R,"So it basically means a lighter that doesn't work. So the small axe, if the small axe is useful primarily for chopping wood and making a fire, and we can't actually make a fire because we don't have a lighter, would there be any other reason why the small axe would be useful, do you think?"
43.283,52.146,C,"That would actually be my only suggestion to take it along, is for cutting and possibly as a security mechanism, protection."
53.669,56.489999999999995,R,"Well, there is a loaded .45 caliber pistol."
56.91000000000001,57.33,C,Correct.
57.57000000000001,58.230000000000004,R,A protection.
59.831,62.91199999999999,C,"So then, yes, it would more likely be just for cutting wood."
64.212,66.052,R,Why would we cut wood?
67.27300000000001,69.05299999999998,C,"Well, to create a fire, to keep warm."
70.71399999999998,73.37400000000001,R,"Without the cigarette lighter, however, we can't make the fire."
73.794,74.19500000000001,C,Correct.
74.97500000000001,80.43599999999999,R,"So that would make the small axe pretty useless, and it would be heavy as well."
82.13699999999999,82.937,C,"No, that's correct, yeah."
85.14800000000001,88.97099999999999,R,"I would suggest that a no would be the best answer to that, what do you think of that?"
90.39200000000001,94.175,C,"I think yes, a no to that would be to the axe, I agree."
94.616,95.25599999999999,R,"Okay, great."
