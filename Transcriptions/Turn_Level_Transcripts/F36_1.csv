2.562000000000001,6.606000000000002,R,"Yep. So, I said no that they shouldn't take this with them."
7.899000000000001,13.721999999999998,C,"Well, I would say yes."
16.764,18.444999999999997,R,Can you light a fire with a ball of steel wool?
19.486,39.113,C,"You can. If you rub two pieces of steel together, you can create a spark, which would be enough to start a fire. I would think, and it's a fairly small thing anyway, so it's not something that's going to take up a lot. Would you agree with that?"
39.132999999999996,43.914,R,"Well, I thought they should take the flint from the lighter to do that."

50.93599999999999,55.57599999999999,R,"Yeah, but I thought they could still use the flint to create a spark to light the fire, but possibly not."
55.596000000000004,76.455,C,"That's why I thought the ball of steel wool If we take that, we can... That's got the potential for creating a spark to make a fire. Okay. Which obviously gives lots of other benefits. So would you agree with that?"
76.91499999999999,77.435,R,"Okay, yes."
78.476,84.198,C,"Okay, so we'll put that down as a yes for the ball of steel wool. Okay."
