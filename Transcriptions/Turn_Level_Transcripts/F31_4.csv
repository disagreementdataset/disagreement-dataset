Yeah, it was a bit burning, and sort of, I mean, fluid-ish. But I don't really know about how much butter burns or anything. I've got a note on it at the moment, but... It probably would burn, I mean, because I know that the cigarette lighter doesn't have fluid. Yeah, see, that's why I was thinking about the ball of steel or wool for the kindling part. The spark, I think, would be all they'd need."
27.917,30.36100000000002,R,"Yeah, the spark in the lighter, yeah, I suppose so."
30.381,32.70500000000001,C,"We can't go back at him, yeah."
32.745000000000005,39.21700000000001,R,"No, we can't go back, can we? I don't know, it just looks quite big and bulky from the picture, but I don't know how representative the picture is."
41.58600000000001,47.170000000000016,C,"Yeah, how many of this is there? The survivors have managed to... It doesn't say how many survivors there are, does it?"
47.39100000000002,48.471000000000004,R,"No, it doesn't say, no."
48.512,52.474999999999994,C,"So, I mean, there could be 300 survivors. Plenty of them, yeah. For all we know."
52.89500000000001,53.474999999999994,R,Yeah.
53.555000000000035,63.38300000000001,C,"But I suppose it's just the most vital things. Like I say, I've got no down for it. I've got no down as well. And we've both come up with a very good reason to do this."
63.40299999999999,67.727,R,"Yeah, I can't think of a particularly good reason apart from maybe burning, but I don't know if that's a..."
68.52900000000002,79.83500000000001,C,"Most of these things we're going to be just guessing anyway to be honest. They're going to come and say, oh no, you've got it completely wrong. I can't imagine us getting it right."
80.39500000000001,82.196,R,So you're saying no for that one then?
83.357,85.21799999999999,C,"For the butter, yeah."
85.31800000000001,86.89900000000003,R,"I've got no as well, so we'll just stick with"
