0.0,3.6429999999999723,R,that. A 750ml bottle of whisky? No.
4.203999999999951,8.307999999999993,C,"It doesn't say anything about anyone being Scottish here, so I said no."
10.869999999999948,14.072999999999979,R,Whisky I think would be useful because of the cold.
15.173999999999978,37.41899999999998,C,"It would be, but If you're going to be out all night and it's minus 40 and you don't have a facility for a fire... Well, I agree to that, but... I can see where you're coming from with taking it."
37.63899999999995,39.53899999999999,R,Why don't you think it would be useful?
40.15999999999997,76.63099999999997,C,"Why don't I? Well, first of all, you could have people end up drinking it all and causing problems with a .45 loaded caliber. It's 750 mils, it's not gonna go on forever. What else? Just the advantage, you know, the idea of it keeping someone warm. Okay, it's not... 100% going to keep everyone warm all the time, so the advantages of taking it, in my opinion."
76.65099999999995,139.01599999999996,R,"Well, if it was rationed accordingly, you know, make a little shot of whisky every few hours throughout night time, then that would reduce the issue of problematic behaviour and it would give a little boost towards the cold. you know, sort of fighting off the cold. I think it would be useful, I think it's... You see the advantage of taking it as opposed to leaving it? Yeah, I don't think the weight is much of a problem and I think the risk of there being a problematic situation is much reduced through a process of rationing and the benefit that you get from actually having it is Okay. Outweighs the risk. That's going to be minus 40 degrees Celsius at night time and they would maybe be thankful for that."
139.75699999999995,142.97899999999998,C,So you consider it as an essential item to survival effectively?
143.719,145.82099999999997,R,"Yeah, I think we did survive with chances."
146.962,150.224,C,"Okay, that's your point. So I'll put a yes to that."
150.24399999999997,152.945,R,So we're going to go with yes? Okay.
