Butter is very, very high energy, so certainly it would be good for food, but initially I thought, well, if it's a can, you need to have a way of opening the can. So initially I'd put down no for the axe, but if you had an axe, you could open the can. Yeah. Erm..."
22.660999999999945,39.78499999999997,C,"Yeah, I mean, I put down no for it, but I don't know, just because I didn't know how useful it would actually be, given that, you know, there's another food thing in the last layer that I thought might be more useful.

49.36699999999996,50.386999999999944,R,I'm happy to say no as well.
50.986999999999966,51.12699999999995,C,Okay.
