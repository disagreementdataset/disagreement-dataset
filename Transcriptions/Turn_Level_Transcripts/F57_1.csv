0.0,5.767000000000003,C,at the top of the list. So item number one. I don't think we need that.
6.508000000000003,46.08,R,"Right. Well, see, I thought we did because of the fact that there are crisscrossing rivers. So unfortunately, not knowing anything about the rivers other than the rivers in Canada. So either there's some that they could perhaps wade through, but assuming that they have to cross a river, if the rivers are crisscrossing in their area, then that forces them to cross a river at some point. So with that in mind, I thought that perhaps they'd have to build some sort of makeshift raft at some point. But also if they built a raft, they could just use the rivers for transport. But yeah, that was kind of my line of thinking."
48.882000000000005,58.628,C,"OK. I mean, I wasn't so sure, because I thought the towns were only 20 kilometers away. I guess if they were using the rivers as a raft. Well, they're 20 miles away. Oh, 20 miles. You're right, yeah."
61.32300000000001,86.181,R,"So I didn't really know, but like if you're crossing a river, but the other thing is we don't know the time at the moment. So they say the temperature is minus 25, but like, you know, if it's like the middle of the day, I mean, still minus 25 is ridiculously cold. And also if you're crossing, I don't think you'd be able to wade through water at like minus 25. And if it is coming tonight, minus 40 degrees, like. I mean, if it's frozen salt, then maybe they could just cross it."
88.161,111.646,C,"I guess my assumption for, my argument for not building a raft would be, if it's at those temperatures, I guess- Yeah, it's gotta be frozen, surely. Well, so it's gotta be frozen, and if they are moving, so they either want to move quickly to where they need to get to, or they want to stay sheltered, so they're probably not gonna spend their time building a raft. Yeah, exactly. If they're gonna chop something down, they're gonna need to make a shelter."
112.22500000000001,138.574,R,"You're right, it's too much effort. I mean, I suppose they could build a shelter without having to chop down branches, et cetera. And yeah, and actually, just like, it's kind of debunking my argument there by like, oh, the temperature is actually really, really cold. So yeah, it's obvious that the water should definitely be frozen. I mean, at least, I mean, minus 40 degrees, it must be thick enough for them to walk over anyway."
139.25400000000002,139.414,UNKNOWN,Yeah.
140.35399999999998,144.61700000000002,R,"So yeah, I would agree that would be a no."
