0.0,2.3009999999999877,C,What about the heavy duty canvas?
5.7309999999999945,7.512999999999977,R,"I think yes, but I don't really know why."
7.572999999999979,19.947000000000003,C,"I think yes, because if, say they're going to be having a sleepover in the woods, they're not going to be wanting to sleep on the ground and get all wet, so that kind of put them, because maybe they could sleep on that and then have the newspapers over them."
20.34699999999998,21.82899999999995,R,So that's kind of like a luxury then?
24.004999999999995,38.438999999999965,C,"Well, probably not because you couldn't use the newspaper as a sleeping mat because it would just get all wet. So for it to actually go on the floor it probably would be quite heavy."
38.478999999999985,42.361999999999966,R,"In 6 metres by 6 metres they probably would all fit on that, depending on how many people there is."
42.962999999999965,44.20399999999995,C,"No, they could all cover up."
44.82499999999999,47.787999999999954,R,I imagine that would be really heavy to carry about.
51.11699999999996,62.053,C,"But then see if you have a tent, like have you ever been in a tent? Yeah. Like have you gone to a festival or something? It's not really that heavy."
62.09299999999996,64.23599999999999,R,Just because it's saying heavy duty I was just thinking it might be.
65.41299999999995,71.49499999999995,C,"Yeah, but it might be heavier than what you'd get at the bottom of a tent, that's true. Well, I put yes."
71.51499999999999,77.23599999999999,R,"Yeah, I put yes as well, I just wanted to try and think that we'd got the right decision."
78.15599999999995,79.87699999999995,C,"Yeah, I'd probably say yes for that one."
