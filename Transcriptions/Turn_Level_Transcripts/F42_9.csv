0.0,1.6219999999999573,C,sectional air mat made of plastic?
2.6829999999999927,22.607999999999947,R,"I said yes, but I wasn't really sure. I was thinking the only reason why they would say yes to that is in the original conversation, With the SOS call, they might have used a map, for example, for directions, but, I mean, I've not actually seen a sectional air map, so I was trying to look in the picture, I don't actually know what it looks like, or what details are on it, so."
22.687999999999988,38.471000000000004,C,"But I think the fact that even, the fact that it has a slight layout of where they're supposed to be heading to, that it would be useful, because they could just be walking in any direction, like, you definitely need a map if you're trying to get out of somewhere. It's like, practically number one, I'd say."
38.98400000000004,41.164999999999964,R,"I would say yes, but do you know what a sectional area map is exactly?"
41.60500000000002,55.58899999999994,C,"No, I don't. I tried to look at it as well, I was like, hmm. It'll obviously be not as good as a normal map, but... I think it maybe at least gives them a starting point. Yeah, that's what I was thinking, at least a basic outline of what direction they're supposed to be heading in."
56.10900000000004,56.849000000000046,R,"So I would say yes, then."
