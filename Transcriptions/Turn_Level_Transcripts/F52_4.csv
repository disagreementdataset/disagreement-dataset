0.9939999999999714,6.315999999999974,R,"Can of butter, I said no. Why did you? It wasn't some secret campaign reason why to have a can of butter."
7.375999999999976,7.995999999999981,C,Secret what reasons?
8.01600000000002,8.77600000000001,R,For energy?
8.795999999999992,23.40100000000001,C,"Yeah, it's the very best thing you can have. Oh, for energy? For energy, in a cold climate, what you want is fat, apparently. Right, okay. In terms of the energy it packs in. The only slight doubt in my mind, and I didn't think to ask this, it says can of butter, and I can't tell from the picture. Do you need a can opener? Is it a tin?"
25.122000000000014,28.083000000000027,R,"Maybe that's just, you know... Probably not."
28.12299999999999,32.21100000000001,C,The picture doesn't look like that. Since when do they put butter in tins anyway?
32.351,47.87700000000001,R,"Maybe it's not an accurate picture for what it's meant to be. I put yes to the chocolate for thinking about energy, but if butter's better. But the thing is, butter is only one can, whereas bar chocolate, they get one each."
48.33699999999999,61.875,C,"True. This is where we're up against... How could it be a wrong decision? This is where we're up against that. To me, if I was in this situation, I would definitely, the first thing I would take would be high energy food before anything else at all."
62.035000000000025,66.37700000000001,R,"Yeah, because they've got to stay warm. So would you say yes to both, the butter and the chocolate?"
66.39699999999999,69.959,C,I would say yes to this one and discuss that one when we come to it.
70.55900000000003,74.74099999999999,R,"Okay, well yeah, I guess the more food the better to keep warm and yeah, okay, but yes."
