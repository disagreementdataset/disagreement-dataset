0.0,0.47999999999996135,C,A pistol.
1.9010000000000105,9.043000000000006,R,"Well, it's heavy and it's not like they've landed in a zombie apocalypse, so I was going to say no for that one."
10.12700000000001,27.57499999999999,C,I was going to say yes because there's quite a lot of bears in Northern Canada. So that was my vote on that one. I've no idea what the official line is on these things.
27.855999999999995,37.25999999999999,R,How heavy is a pistol? Pretty heavy. Solid steel. He says like he's had a lot of pistols.
40.178999999999974,46.281000000000006,C,"I have no idea, it doesn't look very big on the picture but maybe that's not helpful."
46.62099999999998,61.02499999999998,R,They're heavy and they would make a loud noise. The common thing for bears is just be loud and don't surprise them when they run away. You don't generally get attacked by bears unless you don't fall on them.
62.96600000000001,68.22899999999998,C,"OK, so we'll tell them to clap their hands and make a lot of noise rather than carry the pistol."
68.48899999999998,86.637,R,"Sing as you walk and you'll be safe from bears. Sorry? Sing as you walk. I've been doing marching songs. OK. I don't suppose... I mean, it's only 20 miles, so my first thought was they might need to go hunting, but they're going to get there before they run out of...fat."
88.678,89.29899999999998,C,Let's hope so.
90.97899999999998,91.57999999999998,R,I'll be out of a job.
93.20799999999997,95.16999999999996,C,"Right, okay, so we're saying no for the pistol."
95.87,97.411,R,"Okay then, yeah, you happy with that?"
97.91199999999998,98.512,C,"Yeah, go on."
99.113,99.37299999999999,R,Alright.
