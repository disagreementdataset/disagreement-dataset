0.0,1.3810000000000002,R,What about the can of butter?
1.400999999999982,5.623999999999995,C,I can't think of anything to use it for.
5.9839999999999804,14.379999999999995,R,"No, because I thought, okay, they might need food, but who's I don't think they'll be that desperate to just eat butter on its own."
14.680000000000007,21.083,C,"I suppose it's a good source of fat though. Yeah, but um... It's probably between that and the chocolate."
21.423000000000002,28.105999999999995,R,"Yeah, I had a look down at the chocolate and I thought it'd probably be better to take the chocolate. The chocolate would probably weigh less than a can of butter as well."
28.665999999999997,30.806999999999988,C,"Yeah, easier to share too."
31.426999999999992,35.54900000000001,R,"Yeah, you're not kind of scooping your hands into kind of liquid fat."
36.47,36.56999999999999,UNKNOWN,Ugh.
37.962999999999994,39.78399999999999,C,"Okay, so we just keep that one as a no then."
40.084,41.38499999999999,R,"Keep that one as a no, okay."
