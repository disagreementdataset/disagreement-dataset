I understand that your body burns a lot of calories in a cold environment just trying to keep warm. I think that they should just chomp down the chocolate bars straight away, so don't necessarily take it with them. Yeah, um... They don't need the energy when they're travelling."
29.504999999999995,54.49299999999994,C,"That's true. However, rationing on chocolate I know has kept a guy survived, alive. When he was trapped under a boat for a week, he just ate one piece of chocolate a day. Apparently experts said that if he had eaten the entire bar at the beginning, he would have died. So rationing it is the best option, but..."
56.4129999999999,59.855999999999995,R,"It seems to me that they should have it, I think at least."
62.817999999999984,64.29899999999998,C,"Okay, so did you say no?"
64.77999999999997,68.50299999999993,R,"No, I said yes. I thought that, you know, it's basically energy in a bar."
69.5859999999999,72.26799999999992,C,"Sure, okay. I have no idea why I've put no."
73.36799999999994,80.05199999999991,R,"I can't remember. I don't think you should bank on being able to catch and kill and cook or something. Yeah, no, that's true."
82.61399999999992,93.38,C,"We'll put yes, because again, it's not heavy, and it's one per person, so everyone can carry something, so it's not one person. Okay."
94.03999999999996,94.27999999999997,R,Okay.
94.78099999999995,95.5809999999999,C,So we'll say yes.
