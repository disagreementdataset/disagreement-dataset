0.0,1.8620000000000232,C,number four. A can of butter.
2.2420000000000186,26.503999999999962,R,"What do you think about that? I couldn't think of any situation where they'd save themselves the can of butter. I mean it's not particularly useful from the point of view of food. It's not something that immediately jumps out, it's something that I'd want if I were going to survive."
27.264000000000067,31.988999999999976,C,"Yeah, if I thought I'm going to be trapped in some kind of freezing situation, butter is not my first instinct."
32.77000000000004,37.65400000000005,R,"Yeah, but can you think of any situation where it might be used?"
38.33499999999998,49.64400000000006,C,"Like, I don't know, apart from like lathering yourself in butter. help keep you warm, but I mean, I feel there's probably better ways to stay warm than that."
50.14400000000006,64.29599999999999,R,"Yeah, yeah. So I think we can, we both seem to agree that a can of butter is not a particularly useful object to have, or compared to the other ones at least anyway."
64.81700000000006,65.39699999999999,C,"Yeah, definitely."
66.09800000000001,68.24000000000007,R,"So we're agreed, a no for that one?"
68.82,72.32300000000004,C,"Yep. Okay, brilliant."
