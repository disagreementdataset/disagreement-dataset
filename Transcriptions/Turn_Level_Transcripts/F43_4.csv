0.0,0.4199999999999591,R,of butter?
1.5610000000000355,2.282000000000039,C,What did you say?
2.6019999999999754,2.8220000000000027,R,No.
3.4629999999999654,39.678,C,"Okay. Well, I know we're not allowed to discuss further down the list but my original thought was, I hadn't looked down the list, and my original thought was a can of butter would be quite good for just you know, if there's no food for getting calories, basically. But there is food. Given that there is food, I'll agree to no, because I'd put yes and then I'd actually wish that I'd put no, so I'm happy to agree to no, to taking that."
40.25400000000002,46.537000000000035,R,"The only thing I thought of was for lubrication, but then the pistol's loaded and everything, I don't see what lubrication would be needed."
46.557000000000016,56.721000000000004,C,"No, that's the thing, and it's not going to be used as a food source. You wouldn't need butter as a fuel source, really. Don't think so, no. So I'm happy to say no to that."
57.26099999999997,61.66300000000001,R,"Yeah, and my total premise is that they'll be rescued within two days."
62.42399999999998,62.70399999999995,C,Yeah.
63.10400000000004,67.88700000000006,R,Either they'll manage to walk or else they'll be rescued so I don't think they need that much food.
67.90700000000004,89.86000000000001,C,"I mean if they were able, I mean if they had, if they had direct, oh that's the thing, if they had a compass, we're not allowed to speak about air, but if they had a compass they may be able to navigate their way to a nearby town and it would not take that long even in very very mountainous terrain to walk 20 miles."
90.80799999999999,108.94299999999998,R,yeah yeah or even if half of them made it and went back for the others and the rescue people got the others or something but I'm sure that they're not going to be there for days and days and a can of butter is quite heavy so it's a no good good we're doing well
