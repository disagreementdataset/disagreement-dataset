0.0,4.441000000000031,C,"Okay, and what did you say for the sectional air map of plastic?"
4.461000000000013,7.7620000000000005,R,"I put yes, but I don't really know why."
8.402000000000044,15.76400000000001,C,"I put yes because I just thought, well, At least, if it's made of plastic, if it rains or anything, it's going to survive."
15.864000000000033,18.345000000000027,R,Is it a map of the area that we need?
19.76600000000002,42.95300000000003,C,"Well, that's true, actually. That's true. So... I'd put yes, but if it's not... It's annoying that you can't put maybe, isn't it? Because if we could establish where we were, and if it corresponded to where we were, obviously it would be handy to us, but... Like, I don't, because it needs to be yes or no, we kind of need to, what do you think?"
43.51400000000001,50.375,R,"Yeah, I know, I know, I'm tempted to say yeah, but that might be wrong, depending on, how are we supposed to know what the map says?"
51.27600000000001,59.658000000000015,C,"That's true, well, what's our consensus then? I don't really, I'm quite easy about this one, I don't really have that strong opinions on it."
61.01800000000003,68.42100000000005,R,"I'm tempted to say yes, but then I'm thinking, like, we're gonna have loads of yeses and I'm getting the feeling that they're probably all not essential. Do you know what I mean?"
68.98100000000005,70.22200000000004,C,"Yeah, well, we could put no."
71.98200000000003,75.464,R,"We could put no, and then, but how would they know where the nearest town is? Just keep walking."
76.54400000000004,85.84800000000001,C,"Yeah, but then, the thing is, if it was an air map, would pilots and rescue teams not go out to rescue them? And then they would be looking, like, over."
86.78800000000007,90.63000000000005,R,"Yeah. Okay, I'm happy to go no."
91.33600000000007,92.19599999999997,C,Will we just go no?
92.47600000000006,92.75600000000003,R,Yeah.
93.23700000000002,93.55700000000007,C,Okay.
