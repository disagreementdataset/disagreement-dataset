2.821000000000012,32.024,R,"Yeah, a ball of steel will... Do you see any great thinking behind this? Well, I thought, this is why I want to talk about it in relation to the other ones, a ball of steel wool, when I got down to canvas, I was like, well, they'll need shelter, because if you're sheltered from wind and the outside elements, that increases your rates of survival, but you can't secure that without rope or something."
32.684,44.09300000000002,C,"But what do we mean by steel wool? To me, that means like a Brillo pad. I don't think it's something you could get a strand out of to use as rope. I'm pretty sure it isn't. To me, that's something that you'd use as an abrasive, you know."
44.113,51.420000000000016,R,"Right, okay, but is it not like in a coil? Wait, in the picture?"
51.640000000000015,67.469,C,"It's hard to say in the picture, but to me, it's fluffy stuff when you look at it, which is why I'm intrigued by it, because I think you're right. That's probably meant to work in conjunction with something else. Yeah. If it was aluminium or molybdenum or something, you could actually set fire to it probably, but steel, I can't picture it."
69.17000000000002,75.173,R,"No, I don't know what it is. I mean, but you would also have trouble breaking it up, but in order to break it up, you could use the axe."
76.714,92.97,C,"Yeah, but what's it actually for? I mean, it could be, I'm just wondering if you could use it to make a spark. or something. You could use it for cleaning things but I don't think you could sharpen anything with it. I'm probably missing something but I put no to that because I couldn't see what it was for."
93.27100000000002,102.18,R,Yeah I put no to that initially as well. I'm just worried when it gets down to the canvas there's no way to secure the canvas so what's the point of taking it?
104.06800000000001,110.80000000000001,C,"Yes, I see what you mean, but I don't think you have to have ropes or anything with canvas, because if you've got an axe, you can drape it over things and it's still a lot better than nothing."
115.73400000000001,116.174,R,"Right, okay."
116.554,117.95500000000001,C,Should we make a decision on the steel wool?
118.51500000000001,120.256,R,"Yeah, okay."
120.416,121.857,C,"Let's nix that one, I'm probably wrong. So,"
