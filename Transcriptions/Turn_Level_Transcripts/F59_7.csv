0.0,3.162000000000006,R,"yes to extra clothes, for obvious reasons."
4.543000000000006,20.816000000000003,C,"I don't know, I said no because the clothes didn't seem that useful. Oh, okay. And it's just a shirt and trousers. And I thought maybe, you've got the newspapers to provide extra layers of clothing, so they don't really wanna be overburdened with that, I don't know."
21.396000000000015,52.809000000000026,R,"See, I was thinking yes, just in case anything would've happened, because say, for example, they got wet, then they'd need to change out their clothes straight away. So I thought a special coat's covered in snow, and there's rivers and stuff, there's quite a high risk of getting soaked, and if you stay in cold clothes, you're more likely to get hyperthermia. So I said yes, just for, I thought it'd be more useful, just in case, and also if they are cold, then it's an extra layer of something, even if it isn't the most comfortable thing to put on."
54.03199999999998,77.81099999999998,C,"I don't know, I'm kind of, with all the stuff we've got so far, I'm kind of going more towards no, since we've got, I think out of the two things we've got to provide warmth. I take your point about an extra layer to carry with you, but again, you've got to carry it with you, again, rather than wearing it, and with the newspaper, you could kind of just carry it on, so to say."
77.99099999999999,86.40800000000002,R,"I like the newspaper, like, provide warmth, I mean it's only sufficient to like a certain amount you know."
86.64800000000002,91.351,C,I don't know if the shirt and trousers would be that warm either.
91.37099999999998,99.75799999999998,R,I wish they could just take the shirt and not the trousers. So what are your thoughts on that? Do you still think no? I don't know.
99.77800000000002,103.96100000000001,C,I'm thinking this is a limited amount of stuff we're allowed to take. I was kind of going oh no.
106.24000000000001,108.42099999999999,R,okay that's fine then but no
