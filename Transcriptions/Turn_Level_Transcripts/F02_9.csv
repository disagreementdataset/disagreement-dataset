2.4610000000000127,13.942999999999984,C,"Right, for this one I thought it's not going to be very useful. If you're staying put, you don't need a map. And if it's an air map, it's probably not going to be at any kind of detail level that's going to be useful to you, even if you did decide to strike out."
14.423999999999978,74.76499999999999,R,"Yeah, I completely agree. I think if you're staying put, obviously a map is not much use. But also I was thinking of the fact that, well, you wouldn't really, or they wouldn't really know where they crashed either. So, although it's limited use from the point of view of working out where you are, roughly, I don't think there'll be anything specific that's going to give you any sort of information. So, obviously, if they're calling up for advice, let me just double check the scenario. So if they're calling up for advice, phone companies will be able to trace them with a relative degree of, well, maybe not accuracy, but I can't think of a situation if you're staying put where you need a map"
77.67499999999995,77.83500000000004,C,Yeah.
77.85500000000002,84.47900000000004,R,Either work it where you are or go anywhere. So you think they should leave the map?
85.07899999999995,87.03999999999996,C,"I think that's a definite no, as far as I'm concerned."
87.06000000000006,93.44399999999996,R,"That's a definite no, okay. Right. Brilliant. So,"
