0,3.701,R,then the map.
4.242,4.802,C,What did you think?
5.782,47.652,R,"Yeah, I said yes too, but I don't know. have to be someone that would know how to, because the pilot and the co-pilot were killed in the crash, and it's not likely that the passengers on the plane are going to know where to go anyway, but I'm sure there would be, I think you would need a map because if they're going to be able to get out where they are. I think, again, it comes in when we talk about the compass, if we need that, but... I said no, but I don't... Yeah, you might have... Did you say no for the map?"
48.372,55.996,C,"Well, yeah, but I think you're right. I think it makes sense, even for following up."
57.837,59.718,R,I'm not sure. Why did you say no?
60.946,67.548,C,"I went through knowing how to use it, and it's an air map, I don't really know how close that is."
67.608,71.769,R,"Yeah, I don't really know an air-made map, it's not really a specific map."
71.789,73.05,C,My use of maps is terrible.
73.65,85.233,R,"Yeah, I'm rubbish with maps too, so I wouldn't... Maybe they might not be able to understand how to use it, so it could be a waste."
86.334,90.194,C,I'm not sure. What do you think? Would you want a map?
90.494,100.216,R,"I would just say yes because it feels like if you're in the middle of nowhere a map would seem like it would come in useful but it's not like a normal map, it's an air map."
100.816,102.076,C,"Yeah, I'd say yes."
103.336,111.338,R,But I suppose you could always use it to burn things or I don't know.
111.538,116.759,C,What should we say? Say yes.
117.299,117.739,R,You think yes?
119.208,119.728,C,Yeah.
119.788,120.089,R,You sure?
120.109,122.09,C,"Yeah, it's small as well."
122.75,123.851,R,"Okay, okay."
