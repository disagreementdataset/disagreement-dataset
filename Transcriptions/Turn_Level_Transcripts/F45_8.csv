0.0,2.0610000000000355,C,"did you pick for the canvas, the heavy duty canvas?"
2.8420000000000414,3.4220000000000255,R,I said yes.
4.222000000000037,10.285000000000025,C,"See, I wasn't sure about that, because I was thinking if it's heavy duty, they might not want to carry it, and it's a fairly big thing, if it's six by six."
10.906000000000006,13.407000000000039,R,Yeah. How many people is it?
13.427000000000021,16.589,C,It's a good question.
16.609000000000037,29.946000000000026,R,"It doesn't say. Oh. I got it and I thought it was quite a few people. But yeah, I don't know, I just kind of thought it's a pretty simple thing to keep you alive. Yeah, that's the thing, there's only like, there's only two people though."
29.966000000000008,46.81900000000002,C,"Really? Well, no, I was saying, like, they don't tell you, so it might be one of them things where it's like, there's actually only one of you or something like that. Yeah, I don't know, I think... Because everything else is per person, you know? Like, it's for each survivor per person, so if it's only two or three, then you don't really have to carry a heavy duty canvas."
47.287000000000035,54.113,R,"Well, I guess you could also just wrap it around you as you're walking so it wouldn't feel like you were carrying it. I suppose. I didn't say they got any."
54.15300000000002,60.959,C,"It'd be a bit awkward to walk in them if it was one of you, I suppose, but... I'm just thinking it's kind of heavy."
64.82300000000004,71.32800000000003,R,I don't know. I think it's pretty important to have some kind of shelter if you're heading off into the snow.
72.81,73.00999999999999,C,Right.
74.85200000000003,77.97300000000001,R,Or like insulation from the ground or whatever.
78.69300000000004,79.43299999999999,C,"Right, fair enough."
80.733,94.27500000000003,R,"I suppose you could... I'm just sort of thinking, like, the one thing that you'd never unpack if you're going climbing or something is your emergency shelter. Ah, I suppose. Which sounds a bit extreme, but even on a good day you're like, there's my emergency shelter."
94.29500000000002,95.315,C,"Good, good."
96.536,100.356,R,"Not usually camera-less, but anyway."
100.49600000000004,100.79599999999999,C,Right.
