0.0,1.4209999999999994,R,one I think no as well.
2.503,16.072999999999997,C,"Oh, I put yes. Because the area is wooden and I was thinking they could use it for chopping down wood off the trees, etc. if they were going to make a fire. Because they're going to need it to stay warm."
18.995,34.233000000000004,R,"I don't think so because I just think that if they want to keep it down to a minimum, it's really not necessary. And with regard to starting a fire, They're going to need more than just an axe."
35.093999999999994,35.434,C,"True, true."
35.474000000000004,55.75999999999999,R,"So I think it's unnecessary then. And I think, yeah, that would be the reason why. I think it's unnecessary because the wooded area, if I'm imagining a forest, I don't think wood getting in the way would really be the major problem. I was thinking more along the lines of snow, etc. So I would say no to the axe."
56.8,59.541,C,"But how are they going to keep warm, start this fire?"
60.483999999999995,69.027,R,How are you going to keep warm? There are other items later on I think which are more important to us in that aim.
70.848,71.148,C,Okay.
72.128,73.02799999999999,R,So I would say no.
73.628,74.609,C,I'll go with that then.
