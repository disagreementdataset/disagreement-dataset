0.0,6.3230000000000075,C,"yes to the compass because with the map I thought they would... Yeah, I know."
6.342999999999989,23.297999999999973,R,"I was thinking about this too, but... Yeah, I guess with the map and if you had someone that knew what it was doing, that would be really handy, but the alternative is if you would follow the river up to where it's running from, that generally gets you to some sort of source."
26.438999999999993,33.58200000000002,C,"But I mean, it's quite a long-winded way, but... And depending on how sparsely populated it is, it might be... Exactly."
34.26199999999997,36.34200000000001,R,"Might just end up in the middle of the hills, freezing."
38.42999999999998,49.775000000000006,C,"If you were in that situation and you had the compass, then I don't even know... Yeah, I don't particularly know what I would do with it, but maybe we should think about these things in future. Next time we're getting on a flight."

56.595,61.71599999999998,C,"I mean, it would be small, so... Yeah, right, well... Yeah, it's hardly a massive compromise."
61.75699999999998,72.99999999999997,R,"It's not like the newspapers or anything that would probably weigh you down, so... But OK, we'll go for that and just hope that maybe someone knows what we're doing. And also, maybe so that we're not going round in circles."
73.28,78.30100000000002,C,"Yeah, that's true. Yeah, so you can stick... You can choose one direction and keep going that direction, yeah."
78.34099999999998,80.50199999999998,R,"Yep, uh-huh. Yeah, that's a point."
