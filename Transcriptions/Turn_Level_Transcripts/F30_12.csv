0.0,1.0400000000000205,C,And what about the chocolate bars?
1.8009999999999877,11.004000000000019,R,"I've said yes to the chocolate bars, but I'm just looking over to see how many we've said yes to. We've said yes to six so far. Did you say yes to the chocolate?"
11.283999999999992,23.51400000000001,C,"Yeah, I've said yes, I think. Energy as well. First of all, if they can't keep warm and they can't get energy, then they're going to die. That's my first protocol."
23.97399999999999,26.976,R,I wonder if the butter would be enough for energy.
29.218000000000018,64.87799999999999,C,"I just thought if they're out in Canada in the woods, I know they've got the pistol and maybe they could kill some animals, then it's like, can I really eat them? Just like that, I don't know. If they're building a fire, maybe they, I don't think they'd bother cooking them, actually, if they were that desperate, but, I don't know, I suppose energy and warmth is kind of the thing we've gone for, the theme, so, and that's like the kind of most essential, I think."
65.47800000000001,68.16000000000003,R,"Yeah. Okay, so should we say yes to that as well?"
69.13999999999999,69.52100000000002,C,I think so.
69.541,70.52300000000002,R,"Okay, cool. Right,"
