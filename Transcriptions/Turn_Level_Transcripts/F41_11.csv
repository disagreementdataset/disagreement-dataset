19.307000000000016,24.889999999999986,R,Yeah. So... But how come they know where the nearest town is?
25.821000000000026,29.564000000000078,C,"I don't know, it just says the nearest town is 20 miles away."

49.42100000000005,66.67899999999997,R,"Yeah, it's a no-footers direction is north, but maybe the town, yeah. nearest town is there is 20 miles away okay so what are we thinking for compass if we've both got yes i think we should stick with it shall we go stick with yes okay yay good right"
