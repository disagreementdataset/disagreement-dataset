0.0,0.6599999999999966,C,The axe?
3.021000000000001,6.8629999999999995,R,"Okay, so I have said no for the axe."
7.625,16.094,C,"Okay, I said yes, because I thought they could use it for chopping down wood and to create a fire or something to keep warm."
16.594,34.664,R,"Yeah, so at first that's what I was thinking, but then I was thinking to myself, so it's 20 miles and the night time temperature is going to be below 40 degrees. So I think that they probably want to keep moving and not to camp, stop and camp. And 20 miles."
35.084,38.465,C,Is there snow? Does it say if there's snow?
38.885000000000005,66.947,R,"So the average human walking speed, you're talking about three and a half miles an hour normally. So if there's snow you're probably going to see that drop to, worst case scenario, a mile an hour I'd say. So that's a 20 hour walk. If they camp out overnight at minus 40 degrees, it seems to me the chances of survival were lower. So I said no to anything that would be used to set up a camp, and yes to things that would help them to reach their destination."
66.967,76.331,C,"Yeah, okay, that probably, that makes sense. Yeah, okay. In that case we'll agree with that and I'll put no."
76.951,77.131,R,Okay.
