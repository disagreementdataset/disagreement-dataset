1.5209999999999582,9.864000000000033,R,"Um, well I put yes, um, because, uh, it's a good antiseptic for if an animal gets a wound or whatever. Um."
10.743999999999915,20.95399999999995,C,"I put no, cause I, my assumption was they would be drinking it to stay warm, which, uh, Yeah, might impair, impair them."

57.58999999999992,69.93599999999992,R,"Yeah. But as an antiseptic, I suppose also, actually, as a, you could pour out the whiskey, and you could, you know, use it as a store of water, put the snow in it, and melt it, and use it as a water to drink water from."
71.53700000000003,72.91799999999989,C,"Okay, so we'll say yes on that then."
