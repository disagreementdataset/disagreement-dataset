0,1.762,R,"small axe, I said no for as well."
3.083,5.324,C,"Right, I said yes."
7.145,17.999,R,"I said no because it's quite a heavy thing and But yeah, are we not going to be saving them? Do they not just need to wait out for us for a while and then we save them?"
18.379,40.734,C,"Yeah. Because we're a rescue team. I just, I thought it might have, again, I was thinking sort of multi-purpose. You know, if they were out overnight, they could cut branches for shelter because it's a wooded area. But on the other hand, I suppose it's only 20 miles, so they might not need to be out overnight.

73.431,75.292,C,I think I'm persuaded by your argument.
75.912,89.217,R,"Yeah, personally I don't see the need to make a fire, and if it's a wooded area then I'm sure not all the trees are the same height and stuff, there may be branches that have naturally broken and people have dealt with."
89.237,94.62,C,"I know, and if the snow means it's winter so there are possibly branches fallen already."
94.64,97.761,R,"Well, or they'd be easy to break because they're cold."
97.801,100.282,C,"Yeah. Okay, so we'll go for no then, yep."
