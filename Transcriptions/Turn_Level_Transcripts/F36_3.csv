0.0,5.540999999999997,C,"Right, next one, a loaded .45 caliber pistol. I've put yes for that."
6.520999999999987,7.320999999999998,R,"Right, I put no."
9.621999999999986,9.921999999999997,C,Right.
10.581999999999994,12.802999999999997,R,"I mean, the only reason I could think of was self-protection."
13.703000000000003,28.68599999999998,C,"Well, that was, although you might be in the middle of nowhere, it doesn't mean to say you won't have wild animals there, so the reason I put yes is because it's a form of protection. Mm-hmm."
31.237000000000023,41.81900000000002,R,"Would you agree with that, or would you... I think yes, but I don't know what the likelihood, I mean, if they're in a remote area. It depends how long they're going to be out there. I mean, how long are they going to have to be out there before they're found?"
42.49899999999997,82.06400000000002,C,"Well, that's really the unknown. That's one of the unknown factors. You don't know, as I say, if people... If you were planning a trip, I knew you were going to be in these circumstances. It would certainly be easier for you to decide what things you would need because you would have time to sit and think about it and say, well, what am I likely to need this for? I would still think that a loaded gun would be... Yeah, I was still going on this one anyway."
82.10399999999998,85.84499999999997,R,I thought I wasn't sure about it. The only reason I said no was because I don't really like guns.
85.90499999999997,107.10699999999997,C,"Well, I don't particularly like guns either. I've actually fired guns. And I still think they're dangerous. I still don't think they should be allowed. But as I say, in a situation like that, if it's survival, It may be something new."
107.12700000000001,115.48899999999998,R,It may be a good thing to take with him then and possibly be switched to yes on that because I wasn't entirely sure about it anyway.
115.529,117.50999999999999,C,"Right, can we agree on a yes for the gun then?"
117.69,117.96999999999997,R,Yeah.
118.64999999999998,118.85000000000002,C,Okay.
118.87,120.25099999999998,R,In case any bears come along.
121.411,131.52499999999998,C,"Well, it's all very well seeing bears at the zoo but it's a different story when they're actually right next to you. They look nice and curly when they're in a pen."
