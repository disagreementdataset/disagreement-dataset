1.6809999999999832,47.58300000000003,C,"I said yes as a kind of accessory to date with you. mm-hmm I said no and again because if they don't really know where they are then they won't know which direction to go in if you know what I mean like other they know that times 20 miles away they don't know much direction yeah well I suppose but they could at least if they were going to head somewhere they could think I suppose they don't know where they are but if they the nearest town is only 20 miles away they could at least have some idea, if maybe some of them might know how to use a compass and where roughly they were, not where they were, but where roughly to go or to head. I don't know, I thought that was quite useful."
