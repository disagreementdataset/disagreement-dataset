12.088,24.142000000000003,R,"Right, I had actually thought, not taking the ball of steel wool, looking at the other things, I wasn't sure what it would be used for."
24.162,40.545,C,"Yeah, I wasn't, well I mean, I don't know, I wasn't, I mean I thought it because it's multi-purpose, but I suppose it's, I guess if these are the only items that they have, then they might not have the right implements to use the wool with."

55.922000000000004,57.86300000000001,R,It would be handy to have.

68.306,91.62899999999999,R,"I was kind of working on the idea that the nearest towns 20 miles away, and they'll be looking for them by air, that possibly, hopefully, they would be found before there was time to need to construct anything. That was really why I had rejected the ball of steel wool."
92.28899999999999,95.85199999999999,C,"Okay, well, shall we just say no then to the ball of steel wool?"
96.29299999999999,97.594,R,"Right, let's say no to that."
98.234,100.57799999999999,C,"Okay, right. Fine. So consensus no."
