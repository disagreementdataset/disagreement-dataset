3.7350000000000136,5.9570000000000505,R,I said yes to that as well.
6.477000000000032,22.73100000000005,C,"You're just taking everything, aren't you? No, I was going to say no to that because I spoke to my guy and he said as the member of the rescue team I have a basic understanding of where you are and I know where the nearest town is. So I was thinking I could guide you."
23.80400000000003,26.86700000000002,R,What's an air map? What's different to it?
27.027000000000044,51.54400000000004,C,"Yeah, it sounds kind of dodgy, doesn't it, if it's an air map, you know? Like it might not be actually a map that you could use. Oh yeah, I don't really think that. It's a whole trickery thing, double-crossing us right here. Well, if it's not a normal sort of map, I'd probably say no. Yeah, exactly. Unless it sort of says a map of the area, I don't think I'd say no. Yeah, that's very confusing. So we agreed on no for that one then, eh?"
51.825000000000045,52.10500000000002,R,Yeah.
52.721000000000004,53.18100000000004,C,cool.
