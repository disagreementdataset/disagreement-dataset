0.0,0.7609999999999673,C,A can of butter.
1.4009999999999536,26.887999999999977,R,"Yeah. So it's quite a random item, but actually butter is the best source of calories there is going. There is no better source of calories. So actually, whilst it seems quite strange, if they need to stay warm, the amount of fat that is in butter, if they eat that butter, as disgusting as it sounds, it will actually keep them warm and alive."
28.819999999999993,31.081999999999994,C,"Okay, what about as an insulating material?"
31.101999999999975,38.93000000000001,R,"Uh, I suppose it could be used for that. I suppose it could be used for that. It'd probably be pretty, uh, disgusting, but it potentially could do, yeah, I guess."
39.67099999999999,43.61499999999995,C,"I know what you're saying, but do you think it's realistic that they'll eat the butter?"
45.59299999999996,47.27499999999998,R,"Speaking from experience, yes."
47.29499999999996,48.89599999999996,C,I think so.
48.916,70.916,R,"Butter and cheese are the two items that will keep someone warm on a mountain in those kind of temperatures. Mountaineers use butter covered in cocoa for that exact reason. Butter alone is going to be pretty disgusting, but it's the purest form of calories and energy possible. So in a life or death situation, I personally think it's advisable to take the butter."
71.531,74.49199999999996,C,"Okay, we can't discuss future items on the list I think, can we?"
74.632,79.41299999999995,R,"No, we can't, so we'll ignore that. When we get to that I'll give you my reasoning on that one as well."
79.43299999999999,85.31399999999996,C,"Okay, we'll say yes then."
