0.0,0.30100000000000193,R,axe?
0.7409999999999997,1.4209999999999923,C,I said no.
2.8019999999999925,3.3429999999999893,R,Okay.
3.6229999999999905,5.043999999999997,C,What did you say? Did you say yes?
5.503999999999991,46.21000000000001,R,"Well I said yes just from the point of view of again the branches cutting things down because... I thought there might just be enough on the floor. Well but of course it's snowing so I was just wondering if the snowfall you know might cover branches they wouldn't maybe see or at because it said there was a wee bit of forest to get through, if it was quite difficult to get through, a small axe, how heavy is it going to be do you think? Do you think that would sort of weigh them down?"
48.791,50.912000000000006,C,"I just thought, I don't know."
55.42699999999999,75.197,R,"It's quite difficult because it's more, you know, you're kind of trying to imagine what the terrain would be like. I mean it's really cold and there's snow and the countryside is wooded. So it kind of sounds like there might be areas that might just be quite difficult."
75.71799999999999,82.77699999999999,C,"They said there's loads of rivers as well, maybe. Maybe they would have to cut things to be able to cross the river."
85.13899999999998,114.47899999999998,R,"It gives them more scope to cross the river actually, doesn't it? Because it would mean that you could actually cut things down. Make bigger things if they had to cross the river or even cut down big sticks to use as walking aids to get them through or if they had to make any kind of let's say, makeshift stretcher or something. It's just a tool, you know, that they might be able to get. Heavier bits of wood. Heavier. Okay."
115.84,117.25999999999999,C,"Okay. No, let's go yes."
118.44,118.91999999999999,R,You sure?
119.34100000000001,120.92099999999999,C,Yeah. Let's go with that.
122.58099999999999,125.082,R,"The thing is, you could end up saying yes to them all, I suppose."
