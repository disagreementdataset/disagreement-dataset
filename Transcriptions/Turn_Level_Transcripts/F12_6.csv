0.0,6.517000000000024,C,"Um, then was a cigarette lighter without fluid? I have a no for that because if it doesn't have fluid what's the point?"
7.597000000000008,18.344000000000023,R,I said yes because it's the what you say yeah you know the light you can catch things on fire with it the spark I wasn't sure whether that might be any good.
18.364000000000004,28.25,C,Well I was thinking if they're in the countryside and it is wooded they're bound to find pebbles that they can rub together anyway.
29.150000000000006,44.88900000000001,R,Well I don't know I mean it's all snowy isn't it everything's covered in snow and that hmm so finding the right and you need like really specific need flint and like a cigarette lighter without fluid does make a difference yeah I think it would be a good way of starting a fire
45.783000000000015,82.601,C,I don't actually know a lot about cigarette lighters or I mean for that matter whether they have any use without fluid but I mean as you say because there is snow on the ground it would be difficult not to find like dry pieces of pebbles or yeah I don't know what if what if they unloaded the pistol they could start a fire with that.
82.62100000000004,84.142,R,Then they'd have no pistol for shooting things.
84.72200000000004,85.00200000000001,C,Sorry?
85.60300000000001,87.00400000000002,R,Then they'd have no pistol for shooting.
87.404,100.61200000000002,C,No but if they unloaded it they'd still have the pellets right for the pistol yeah if they had to start a fire they could probably use the pistol for that like obviously unload it first and I don't know doesn't it have like a spark
101.62299999999999,123.77199999999999,R,no pistols I think they're I don't know if they have a spark they just kind of propel the thing out so they don't generate any heat I don't I don't know I don't don't know enough about guns they do when they fire but I don't know whether you could take it apart and start a fire with it I think that requires some kind of technological know-how of guns which these people might not have if they're at a business conference or whatever
124.46600000000001,131.63400000000001,C,"This is true, this is true. Okay, I'm inclined to say yes for the cigarette lighter."
131.67400000000004,133.336,R,"Yeah, okay, we'll go with yes then."
133.596,135.478,C,"Okay, yeah. Fire starter and"
