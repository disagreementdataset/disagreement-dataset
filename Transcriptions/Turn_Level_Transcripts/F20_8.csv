0.0,1.0600000000000023,R,Heavy Duty Canvas.
3.555999999999983,10.440999999999974,C,"I can see that it might be helpful if they are wanting to sit down and sleep, but it's huge."
11.122000000000014,13.163000000000011,R,It is huge.
13.584000000000003,15.365000000000009,C,And I imagine quite heavy.
15.485000000000014,22.96999999999997,R,"I don't know, I've said no, but I think... See, I said yes just for the waterproofness, if they had to end up sleeping somewhere."
23.471000000000004,29.33499999999998,C,"Yeah, and I presume, because 20 miles, how long would that even take you?"
29.67500000000001,31.98199999999997,R,"I don't even know. A dream, maybe?"
32.76299999999998,47.490999999999985,C,"Yeah, yeah. But I guess over awful terrain and stuff, so I was like, will they want to make a tent out of it? I really don't even know. Six metres by six metres. There should be people who could carry that."
47.750999999999976,48.05099999999999,R,Yeah.
48.07099999999997,56.495000000000005,C,"Yeah, because I was thinking, I wrote no, but I was like, I could probably be persuaded about this one, to be honest. Do you think it would be useful?"
58.19599999999997,68.88,R,"I think so, but then it depends. I just think if they're going to be spending a lot of time, they're going to have to rest and stuff eventually. And they don't want to be sitting in snow."
69.74000000000001,70.161,C,"Yeah, true."
70.20099999999996,71.36099999999999,R,That was my main thinking.
71.702,77.62599999999998,C,"Yeah, because they don't have anything else to sit on. I think you're probably right."
77.64600000000002,78.50599999999997,R,Okay.
78.86599999999999,85.13099999999997,C,"Okay, so we can say yes, because hopefully that's not going to be... Although, is canvas waterproof?"
87.65199999999999,89.49399999999997,R,Depends what kind of canvas. Heavy duty?
90.49399999999997,99.36199999999997,C,Yeah. yeah maybe yeah let's just say yes they can abandon it okay i don't know if that's how this works um
