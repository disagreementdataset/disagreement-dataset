17.68399999999997,48.17599999999993,R,"Well, I think that was... I mean, I think that's a valid reason, but also I was thinking that, you know, it's actually extremely cold, and if they're wearing business clothes, I mean, I think doubling up the layers is gonna help you anyway. So if you, like, wore double layers, so I thought it was a definite yes, because I think if you double up your layers, I think you'd have to. It might be 25 degrees, and if you're dressed for, like, a business meeting, you're gonna freeze. So if you're wearing them, I mean, obviously it's still the same weight, but it's not an inconvenience. It's like part of what you're wearing. It's not like you're carrying it. So I would say yes as well."
48.735999999999876,51.23799999999983,C,"Okay. So we're agreed on that one then, yes?"

52.197999999999865,54.278999999999996,C,Perfect. Right.
