0.7599999999999909,1.280999999999949,C,"No, on you go."
1.8409999999999513,2.8409999999999513,R,The canvas.
3.3209999999999695,4.381999999999948,C,Uh-huh. No.
4.401999999999987,7.282999999999959,R,"I thought, I know, I said a yes for that one. You did?"
7.7029999999999745,8.123999999999967,C,All right.
8.643999999999949,12.424999999999955,R,"Just for heat purposes, because you could look fashionable until you shelter."
12.444999999999993,33.32099999999997,C,"I just thought it would be too heavy to carry. Yeah. Because it's six metres by six metres. I don't know what kind of desk you're sitting at, but I'm probably at a two-metre desk. Yeah. It says it's heavy-duty canvas, so I wondered. I mean, that's why I said no. Well, I said yes because it doesn't tell you how many people there are."
33.36099999999999,49.40299999999996,R,"There could be four or five, for example. that two at a time could carry it. I do a thing called OTC, Officer Training Corps, in uni. I've worked with quite a lot of stuff that's like this."
50.18299999999999,52.903999999999996,C,I've carried logs up and down hills as well.
52.964,64.24899999999997,R,"It's quite heavy, but they're really cosy as well, if you manage to fashion it out into a wee shelter. That could keep you happy for a while."
64.28899999999999,86.75899999999996,C,"Yeah, I suppose so. Okay well I'm happy to be persuaded by you because I'd put no but sort of when I was making notes I'd put shelter but heavy. if you assumed that maybe two people could carry, I mean I have no idea what it would feel like, you've probably got a better idea, but it's manageable for one or two people to carry."
88.05899999999997,110.255,R,"Because I don't know how far they would have to move away from the crash, because from my idea of what would happen is they would just go and find shelter for a wee bit and then their spokesperson or whatever would manage, would be able to direct a helicopter to near, so then they'd just have to move another wee bit again. So it wasn't really a... Okay."
110.89499999999998,114.35699999999997,C,"Right, well, you have persuaded me. Yeah, of course I have. Uh-huh."
