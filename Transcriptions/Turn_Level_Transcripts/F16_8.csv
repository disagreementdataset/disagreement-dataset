4.463999999999999,14.110000000000014,R,"Yeah, I put yes only because it could be used as a shelter. It could, but I wondered if, like... But then it is, because it is quite heavy, that was my thought as well."
15.211000000000013,36.379999999999995,C,"Well, the difficulty is that I'm not really sure whether they're trying to get out or whether they're just waiting rescue. Because if they are just waiting for rescue, then the cannabis is more, like, useful. But if they're just going to... Well, they have to leave the site of the accident. So you have to carry that."
36.75999999999999,42.079999999999984,R,"Yeah, it doesn't say if they're... if they're walking, because I kind of assumed that they'd be walking."
42.620000000000005,46.14299999999997,C,Aha. But I don't know if they're trying to walk to the nearest town.

57.791,59.03199999999998,R,But then canvas gets wet.
59.91199999999998,61.212999999999965,C,"Yeah, the canvas would get pretty wet."
61.39299999999997,63.55500000000001,R,Is it waterproof? Maybe we should say no for that then.
64.19900000000001,67.041,C,"Okay, right. We'll go for no canvas."
67.66199999999998,68.34199999999998,R,No canvas.
68.36199999999997,70.964,C,And hope the newspapers and extra trousers are enough.
