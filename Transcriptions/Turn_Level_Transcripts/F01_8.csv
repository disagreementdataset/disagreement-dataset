0.0,1.3410000000000082,C,The heavy-duty canvas.
4.04099999999994,15.904999999999973,R,"So that's something I've put yes for, and then I've been thinking, it's really heavy. If they're not going to camp out, because it's big, 20 foot by 20 foot, it's huge."
17.505999999999972,89.98800000000006,C,"Yeah, so it's a big piece of canvas, it's going to be heavy, but on the other hand, it could be quite useful for... She says, I'm just sorry, I'm reprocessing because the next one underneath says a sectional air map made of plastic and I'm thinking that maybe, well we don't know how big that is, but maybe actually the canvas role could be fulfilled by the plastic map. only smaller. If we stop thinking of it as a map, start thinking of it as a sheet of something. Now I've no idea how big it is. But, I mean, I was thinking that, you know, the canvas they could use for things like, if they have to camp, then they could use it for that. They might want to use it to carry the other stuff in, because we've got no idea whether they have a bag, so they need to, like, wrap it up and put it in something. They could use it... Sorry? We've not given them much to carry so far. Actually, we've given them nothing to carry so far. We've given them the axe."
90.3889999999999,90.86899999999991,R,And a lighter.
90.8889999999999,105.0329999999999,C,"Yeah, well the lighter can go in the pocket, so that's not really an issue. The heavy duty cap is okay, but they could potentially use it as, I don't know, they're not really going to be able to make a raft from it, are they?"
105.57299999999987,116.25700000000006,R,"No, they're not able to make a raft. I'm thinking, you know, make a tent, wrap up in it. Well, there's snow on the ground, so like Bear Grylls would tell them to build in and make a little hole."
118.59699999999998,118.97699999999986,C,Yeah.
120.67799999999988,121.57799999999997,R,It's a very heavy thing.
121.77800000000002,128.92100000000005,C,That's the only problem. Yes. So what's our rate on that?
128.94100000000003,132.74299999999994,R,"I said yes. I'm moving towards no, I think. What do you think?"
135.48399999999992,137.32500000000005,C,"I'm happy to go with no on this one, if that."
138.30500000000006,139.7059999999999,R,Yeah. Okay.
141.106,142.20699999999988,C,So we're going to go with no on
