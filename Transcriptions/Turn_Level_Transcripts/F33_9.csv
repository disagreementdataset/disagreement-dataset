0.0,1.2410000000000423,R,What about the map?
2.3420000000000414,10.969000000000051,C,"I thought... Like, they're not gonna know which direction the nearest town is. But I don't know if the map's gonna tell them that."
12.230000000000018,19.67700000000002,R,"I wasn't sure either because... And they're not gonna know where they've gone down either. Oh, yeah. Yeah, because the pilot and co-pilot are dead, aren't they?"
19.697000000000003,20.437000000000012,C,Yeah.
21.437000000000012,42.922000000000025,R,"Hmm. Uh... Yeah, that's a good point. I wasn't sure because it really depends if any of them just happen to know how to use a map and a compass. But... Do you think they would be? Because it says here they go into a business meeting, so... Yeah, I've just, um... Well, a compass is fairly easy to use."
42.98200000000003,81.04600000000005,C,"I'm pretty sure somebody would be able to know how to use that. but the fact that they don't know where they are on the map. Okay. And whether an air map actually has locations in a large area of Northern Canada. And also I've just read the thing and it says you have just received an SOS call from a group of people that survived a plane crash and report on the situation as follows. If they've reported an SOS call, then they've got the call and the most sensible thing for the people to do, I've just realized, is to stay with the plane?"
82.06700000000001,127.47300000000007,R,"Yeah, that's what I thought as well. So, actually, I wonder... I don't know, well it says in this example, it just says here that they have to leave the site of the accident. It didn't say why, but, I mean, I think you're right considering the kind of people that were in the crash. they probably won't know where they are. Yeah. And I guess if the, the black box in the plane or something, if they managed to, they'll be able to like kind of track whereabouts that may have gone down and then the rescue team could search the area for them. So I, okay. So I think that they shouldn't take it."
130.29500000000007,131.77600000000007,C,Yeah. I don't think it'd be any help.
132.87700000000007,134.65800000000002,R,Okay. So both putting no for that one.
134.83800000000008,135.038,C,Yeah.
135.67899999999997,135.899,R,Okay.
