0.0,1.8600000000000136,R,feelings on the ball of steel wool?
3.7600000000000193,7.1410000000000196,C,I couldn't really see how that would help them particularly. I wouldn't have thought you'd need that.
7.9010000000000105,42.46400000000003,R,"No, I was, I'm along the same lines of thinking. So what, I was trying to think about where it could be useful and I was thinking maybe if you're I don't know, trying to make some sort of shelter, whatever you might use it for that, or if you're crossing rivers. But I think, as I say, they're probably best staying put. Steel wool, I don't know whether steel wool would be particularly heavy. I mean, I don't really know what they mean by steel wool. whether we're just going to weigh people down or whatever."
42.48400000000001,48.00700000000003,C,"Yeah, I can't see how it would be essential to their survival."
48.12700000000004,65.559,R,"No, I can't think of any situation where, like, obviously if there was lots of space then you might think of situations where it was useful. So we'll both agree that a ball of steel wool, not an essential."
66.179,67.12000000000003,C,"Yep, that sounds good."
67.70000000000002,70.571,R,"Agreed, okay. Writing no here."
71.131,71.311,C,Yep.
72.292,76.23300000000003,R,Brilliant. Number one down. I have more to go here.
