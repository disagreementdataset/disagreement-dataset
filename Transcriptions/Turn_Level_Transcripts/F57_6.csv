3,31.591,R,"so I had that then as a yes just for using it to start the fire and well I had it as a yes as well but then obviously if we're taking the gun then it's actually the the click the spark of the lighter you can obviously get the same from the the gun barrel um so I'd be inclined to say no now but then I don't know that for me it's like It's a bit of a kind of no-brainer. There's no reason not to take it. It weighs nothing, you know, and it might have a use."
31.611,35.693,C,"For that reason only. I mean, if something did happen to the gun, at least you've got a backup then."
35.893,48.46,R,"Yeah, so it's just like, it just seems like a no-brainer. The only thing that put me off taking it is just the fact that perhaps we're meant to be very economic with our items and just like say no to things that would not potentially have a use."
