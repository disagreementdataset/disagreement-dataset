0.0,24.359000000000037,C,"got done yes but only because I reckon it'd be easy to kind of find out, I mean they already seem to know sort of where they are but I suppose if somebody manages to get a call into you, you'd be able to say like kind of more roughly whereabouts you are. I'm not really sure though."
24.69900000000007,30.40300000000002,R,"Aye, well, I mean, there's that, but the thing I was thinking about, if it's just business types, you could be looking at a map and you still wouldn't know where you are anyway."
31.323000000000093,32.644000000000005,C,"Aye, that's a good point actually, aye."
32.704000000000065,50.39499999999998,R,"It's an air map, do you know what I mean? It's really, it's for pilots. You've got to be able to know your latitude and longitude, do you know what I mean? You've got to be able to track it as you're going and... Aye, that's quite a good point then, aye. Unless you had one of these digital GPS things that gave you your things, I kind of don't actually see how much use it would be to six businessmen anyway that spend their time sitting in an office."
51.03600000000006,52.23700000000008,C,"Aye, aye, no, I can't really..."
53.307000000000016,62.769000000000005,R,"I thought what I was thinking basically was, it tells you that there's rivers criss-crossing over the place and it's something kinda, so I'd imagine that the rivers are going to be used for logging."
63.98900000000003,64.24900000000002,C,Aye.
64.269,73.471,R,"But you could basically do, instead of using the map and the compasses, basically just head down to the river. The river will end up going through a town at some point. It will probably go to the nearest town, in fact, because they always build towns near water, don't they?"
74.57100000000003,75.81100000000004,C,"Aye, aye, that's a really good point."
75.83100000000002,98.03399999999999,R,"You could just, instead of the compass and the rest of it, man, just basically just head for the river and then follow downstream. I think the snow will be lighter down there as well obviously because you've got the water that sort of melts the snow away so you can jump through really really deep snow if you stay as close to the water as you could. It's going to save your legs a bunch of energy. Aye, totally."
98.09500000000003,103.13800000000003,C,"Now, I think that's fair enough then, aye? So be it like I know for the map then, aye?"
104.09900000000005,120.60700000000008,R,"Aye, I suppose that's what I was going to go with. Initially it seems like a very handy thing to use, but unless you know where you are. I mean, you're talking about a plane crash can do. I mean, who actually follows a plane crash when you're a passenger? You just, you know, you take off at one place and you go down somewhere else. You never know where you are in between."
120.62700000000007,133.23000000000002,C,"Ah, exactly. Plus, if there had been a plane crash, it would be a wee bit disorientated anyway, so using a map probably would have been the best idea. Oh, definitely, man. So, right. Moving on to the next one."
133.95000000000005,137.27200000000005,R,"I think it's a safe bet we've both done a  for the map, ain't we?"
138.192,139.03300000000002,C,"Aye,  for the map."
