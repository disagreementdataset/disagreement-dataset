0.0,6.728,R,"So for the ball of steel wool, I think it would be useful to carry with them"
7.576000000000002,9.498,C,Why do you think that would be?
9.978,34.177,R,"Well, for different things, like, for example, with the heavy-duty canvas, you could use the steel wool in the canvas to tie it around the trees to keep them off the floor. So it can almost be like a giant hammock, in a sense, because it is a heavy-duty canvas. So then, if it's raised off the floor, then the people, when they're sleeping, they're not going to be lying in the snow and getting cold."
35.506,45.072,C,"I don't know though, it's quite cooled up in there. I don't know if it would make that much difference with the canvas as well. I think you can find other ways of doing it."
46.432,54.737,R,I just think it can be useful for just different things but what are your thoughts on it?
56.976000000000006,68.967,C,I don't know. I think it's got pretty limited application. I think there are other things that would be more useful in the long term. That's my thoughts.
68.987,70.56899999999999,R,Would you like to write no then for that?
71.009,73.17099999999999,C,"I think so, yeah."
