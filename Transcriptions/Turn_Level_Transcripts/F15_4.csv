2.061999999999955,3.262999999999977,R,"Can of butter, I'd put no."
4.142999999999972,16.887999999999977,C,"Right, I also had no. I could see where it could come in handy, though. I don't know, I was just thinking how swimmers would sometimes cover themselves in butter to keep heat in."
17.688999999999965,20.091999999999985,R,"I don't know, I've never heard about that."
21.353999999999985,35.26999999999998,C,"I don't think it's used so much nowadays, but outdoor swimming people would... cover themselves in grease, butter, that sort of thing to keep eating, but I still can't see it being that much use."
35.40999999999997,40.25399999999996,R,"I think in the context of the other items, and the weight of it. You've got no. I've put no, yeah."
40.63399999999996,45.236999999999966,C,"Right, so I'd just keep it at a no as well. Yeah, okay, so I agree. Because obviously I don't want to weigh them down."
46.21799999999996,47.91899999999998,R,"Yeah, exactly, so I agree down a no for that."
48.23999999999995,49.42099999999999,C,Yep. Okay.
