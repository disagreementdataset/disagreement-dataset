0.0,1.0399999999999636,R,Heavy duty canvas?
2.120999999999981,3.020999999999958,C,I said yes.
3.8220000000000027,6.159999999999968,R,OK. I said no.
6.240000000000009,19.471000000000004,C,I thought about this for quite a while because I was like it's going to be really heavy but then I was like it is big and they could all fit under that if they needed shelter for a while.
19.490999999999985,26.635999999999967,R,I know because I was kind of thinking it's going to be really really heavy because it's six meters by six meters heavy duty.
26.65599999999995,28.117999999999938,C,Yeah that's what I thought as well.
28.477999999999952,40.875999999999976,R,"And you know if we've got the axe to cut down branches to make a shelter is that actually going to, you know, to carry that distance?"
41.775999999999954,43.396999999999935,C,"Yeah, it might be more hassle than it's worth."
44.097999999999956,54.20399999999995,R,"And there's no, they've not really got anything that they can cut it down with, you know, into smaller... And it's pretty huge, six metres by six metres."
54.76400000000001,57.88599999999997,C,"Yeah, it would take more than one person to carry as well."
58.50699999999995,59.70799999999997,R,I think it would be really heavy.
60.02800000000002,63.789999999999964,C,"Okay, yeah, let's say no. Especially if it's going to be walking for that long."
63.809999999999945,64.75099999999998,R,"Well, that's it, yeah."
