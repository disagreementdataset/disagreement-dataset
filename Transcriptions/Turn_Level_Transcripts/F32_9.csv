0.0,1.3010000000000161,C,the next one's going to be interesting.
2.261999999999972,2.7820000000000107,R,A map.
3.4829999999999757,6.7050000000000125,C,I said no because it was an air map.
7.284999999999997,12.00800000000001,R,"Yeah, I was wondering about that. I'd be a little bit useless."
12.027999999999992,14.12899999999999,C,I have no idea what an air map looks like.
14.68999999999997,17.231000000000023,R,I'm trying to see the picture but it's really hard.
17.832000000000022,24.416000000000025,C,"It should have shown the outline of the land but it doesn't really show roads or anything, I don't think."
26.297999999999973,35.60099999999997,R,"Because I was thinking, well maybe it will show the roads because they won't be able to see, but I guess if it's just from the air then it's just going to be blobs and it's not going to be much. That's true."
36.58099999999999,44.48400000000001,C,"What do you think? If you can argue me out of it, I'll agree with you, but you have to argue me out."
45.304,50.446,R,"Oh no, I don't know. Because I said no and then yes for that one."
51.18699999999998,55.08899999999997,C,Oh did you? Right. So you wavered.
55.10900000000001,59.47200000000001,R,Yeah just the ear map. What is an ear map?
60.071999999999974,66.03599999999997,C,I did think could they do anything with the plastic but I don't think. We've got the canvas so that's okay.
66.05600000000001,69.97900000000001,R,I'd probably go no then.
72.33599999999998,75.53900000000002,C,We're right in this or these poor people are going to die. I know.
76.55999999999997,77.58000000000001,R,"So, no. No."
77.6,79.84200000000001,C,Do you say no? Okay.
80.90299999999999,82.965,R,"Okay,"
