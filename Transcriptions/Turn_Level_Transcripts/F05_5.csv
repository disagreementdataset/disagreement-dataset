0.0,0.7199999999999989,C,um... Newspapers.
1.7210000000000036,11.127999999999986,R,"Okay. So, bizarrely, I've said yes, because I'm... I know that in... I know that homeless people pad their clothes out with newspapers to keep warm,"
12.450999999999993,17.71199999999999,C,"Yeah, um, carrying one newspaper is not exactly heavy."
17.912000000000006,48.896000000000015,R,"I put no originally because I thought, I was thinking fire, but then thought, oh, if they've got the axe, then we could... I'm really just going through the whole warmth aspect here, so the newspaper's got lots of layers that traps heat in, so if there's one per person, you can just stuff their clothes with it and keep their business warm. Of course, on the other side, the newspaper gets wet and there's snow on the ground, so that's obviously... Yeah, and I suppose if it's not actually snowing, then they'd probably be right on their top half."
49.636000000000024,57.238,C,"Possibly the bottom half would be pretty cold, but it might make walking quite awkward. It depends how you wrap yourself up, I suppose."
57.25799999999998,60.278999999999996,R,"Well, they only have business suits on, so they're going to get frostbite if they don't have something."
61.259000000000015,64.44,C,"Yeah, true. They do have extra trousers, though."
65.89999999999998,72.481,R,Yeah. But it's probably a lot easier to stuff your clothes with newspaper than it is to wear two pairs of trousers.
73.62200000000001,75.043,C,Okay. Right.
75.14299999999997,94.156,R,"I'm not sure. If it's just a business suit, then that's not going to make that much of a difference. I don't know. I've just heard that newspaper is a good thing for keeping you warm in the cold, but it's obviously not ideal if it's going to be wet, so you don't want anything wet on your skin, so... I wouldn't say I'm fully confident of my yes there, but..."
94.78899999999999,108.673,C,"I think I'd probably agree with you because it's not exactly going to be a heavy item to carry and if it does get wet, they can just dispose of it. It's not recyclable or biodegradable."
108.95299999999997,113.214,R,And it could of course be used to start a fire of some sort.
114.375,118.01600000000002,C,"True, that's true. Okay, so should we say yes?"
119.05399999999997,127.298,R,"Yeah, I said yes quite a lot of these items, so I'm... It's not going to cause any harm."
