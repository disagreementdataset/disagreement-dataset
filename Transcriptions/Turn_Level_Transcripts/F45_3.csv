0.0,1.781000000000006,C,Can of butter? How do you feel about that?
2.180999999999983,3.8419999999999845,R,I just said yes because it's something to eat.
5.906999999999982,7.588999999999999,C,"Seriously, who eats butter?"
7.888999999999982,10.290999999999997,R,"Well, it's full of fat and it's pretty cold."
10.330999999999989,23.10300000000001,C,"I suppose. It's hard to do but... I said no. I was like, what are you going to do? Grease yourself up? Because you're not supposed to carry everything, are you? No, yeah, I don't know."
23.12299999999999,29.688999999999993,R,I think because it's so cold and then it's so fatty that I think I'm taught to get this tradition to basically just eat butter.
32.994,52.234999999999985,C,"What do you reckon? I don't think it should bother, because I've said a yes to a bunch of other stuff, so I don't want to, like, I was trying to sort of narrow stuff down for you not to. Because there's the chocolate bars afterwards as well, so it's like, maybe you just stick to them. Although you could dip them in the butter, you know?"
53.226,58.58699999999999,R,"Yeah, I don't know, I was just sort of thinking you'd be gutted to sort of not, to get lost and run out of food."
60.067999999999984,74.43099999999998,C,"Can you imagine if you were stuck in Northampton? Would you really eat butter? I think, yeah. Yeah? Really? No, I can't, I couldn't do it. I couldn't eat the butter. Okay. I'm saying no. I'm putting my foot down."
75.351,75.571,R,Okay.
