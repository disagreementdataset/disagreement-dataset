6.682000000000002,12.583999999999989,R,"No, I put no. I thought it would be too heavy and they wouldn't need it. They should be able to gather enough."
14.644999999999996,31.47999999999999,C,"Well, I've put yes because it's really... My reason for that would be it's a cutting tool. As such, you know, may be beneficial. As I say, I don't know, what are your thoughts on the matter?"
33.821,61.609999999999985,R,"I don't see why they would need to use that. If it was for cutting branches for fires, then they should be able to gather enough already. I mean, they'd want sticks that are fairly dried out anyway, so ones that are going to be in the forest. So they will already be lying on the ground. So you would think that the axe was... I think it would expend too much energy hacking away at a log with an axe."
62.75,79.674,C,"Well, I can appreciate that point of view. I just felt it was something that would be classed as... Well, I would class it as a small survival tool. As I say, it's..."
82.864,110.46199999999999,R,"Just don't know if they need to be carrying it with them. I mean, what else would they need to cut other than wood? Because you need to be gathering a fair amount of kindling anyway, which you can I mean, you can't really start off with big massive logs, you're not going to light a fire with that."
110.642,116.30799999999999,C,"As you say, there's probably enough small pieces of wood about without the need for an axe."
116.488,120.25199999999998,R,"And it's heavy. Even if it's a small axe, it's still a heavier item."
122.314,125.297,C,"OK, well, we'll agree and no for the axe then. OK."
