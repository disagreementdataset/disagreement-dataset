0.0,44.14799999999991,R,"um, bottle of whiskey. I had this as a no. I think, um... I don't know the medicinal properties of it, but I think, other than pastimes, I'm not entirely sure it would particularly warm you up or would be particularly good from the point of view of survival. Other than entertainment, I don't think there's anything there that I would need I kind of went back and forth on this one."
44.16800000000012,50.093000000000075,C,I sort of thought that maybe you could burn it.
50.833000000000084,58.940000000000055,R,"To be honest, I don't know how it burns so I didn't think of it to soak a newspaper in."
60.16100000000006,79.2940000000001,C,"I initially put it down as a yes just for that reason but I was kind of wavering back and forth on it because I don't know how well it burns and how long it's going to last and whether it's going to be any better than I've already got an axe to get wood. And I've got the newspaper if need be, so maybe I can see why that would be a no."
80.375,126.77800000000002,R,"So I was thinking it was down there because it was, you know the old St Bernard dogs bringing brandy to people trapped in the mountains. Lots of people drink it to keep warm in a cold night, but whether it's actually any use to keeping warm, I'm not entirely sure. So the only use I was thinking of was I don't know whether that would be any help whatsoever. I don't know, have you ever tried anything like that before? I'm willing to be persuaded in this one, because I'm not entirely sure how it would work."
127.45900000000006,134.461,C,"Yeah, but I'm not really very sure either, so I think in that case we should probably just leave it out, because if it is going to be useless, we... Yeah, okay."
134.92100000000005,136.56099999999992,R,I'm happy with no there.
137.22199999999998,138.06200000000013,C,"Okay, let's do that then."
139.0820000000001,139.32200000000012,R,Okay.
