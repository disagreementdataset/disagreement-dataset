0,0.44,R,pistol.
1.681,10.104,C,"I said no. Okay. But I thought maybe yes because, I don't know, I guess in North Canada you don't know what you're kind of going to come up against."
10.124,16.066,R,"Yeah, that was the last one I actually did and I said yes in the end but I don't know how necessary it is."
16.606,18.207,C,Yeah. Okay.
18.567,19.447,R,What do you think we should go for?
22.783,24.383,C,Shall we go for yes?
25.584,32.145,R,"Okay, yeah. Yeah? It's okay. Or we can hold it as a not decided yet if you want to go back to it."
32.185,32.505,C,Yeah.
32.725,33.205,R,Okay. Okay.
33.793,34.253,R,"Oh, the gun."
34.273,35.974,C,"Yeah, should we put no?"
37.314,38.615,R,"Yeah, I'd probably, yeah."
38.955,42.016,C,"Just because it says, like, you want as few objects as possible."
42.576,43.356,R,"Yeah, exactly, yeah."
43.556,44.516,C,That same thing.
45.657,48.977,R,And there's no other thing we could do with a ball of steel?
49.478,49.858,C,Nah.
50.558,51.198,R,No.
51.218,53.059,C,"So, no for the gun, or yes?"
57.339,58.62,R,Now I'd probably say no.
59.08,60.261,C,"Yeah, I think I would too."
60.641,69.389,R,I think the main objects that we've kind of picked is that they try and seclude themselves until they get found and that's all about warmth and energy kind of thing.
69.509,72.732,C,"Yeah, yeah. Okay, so no. Okay."
