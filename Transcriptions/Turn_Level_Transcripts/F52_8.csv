3.7799999999999727,5.780999999999949,R,Well I said yes but it is really heavy.
6.36099999999999,22.834999999999923,C,"I said yes as well but because in a way I mean a shelter is pretty important. I'm just wondering whether they're wanting us to say look if they don't get found by nightfall they've had the chips. and the canvas is big and heavy. So it's six by six, 20 foot square, that's a big chunk of canvas."
22.995000000000005,51.289999999999964,R,"But if we're thinking in terms of what is the, you say you've got to find, to maximise the chances of survival. So by bringing shelter, you are maximising your chances of survival. If it was me, you'd be thinking about the three main things, like warmth, survival, covering yourself from exposure to the elements and finding a way for people to know where you are."
51.309999999999945,56.71199999999999,C,I mean because one thing that they don't even touch on is whether you'd actually move anywhere.
58.19200000000001,59.11299999999994,R,And whether or not you'd what?
59.65300000000002,63.874000000000024,C,"Whether you'd go anywhere at all. I mean I think... Oh, you'd stay to the plane crash?"
63.894000000000005,64.83399999999995,R,"No, but it sounds like you'd have to leave."
64.85399999999993,70.88299999999992,C,"You've got 20 miles to go if you need to. if you decide to do that, but that's quite a long way through that terrain."
70.96299999999997,78.11099999999999,R,"Oh yeah, they don't have to, no they won't go to the nearest town, it says they have to leave, where is it, they have to leave the site of the plane crash."
78.75199999999995,78.99199999999996,C,Right.
80.81399999999996,81.856,R,But they don't have to go far.
82.77699999999993,85.74000000000001,C,"I'm trying to find it, I must have lost that bit, right."
85.92099999999994,111.86500000000001,R,"Yeah, it says like, But they have to leave the site of the accident carrying only a few objects, the less the better, in order to increase their chances of survival. So if the plane isn't about to blow up, they can't use the plane for shelter obviously, but I think they definitely need shelter, otherwise imagine being exposed"
112.35500000000002,113.95600000000002,C,"Yeah, I can't deny that."
113.976,118.55700000000002,R,"Yeah, you know how death by exposure, people die because of exposure. Absolutely, yes."
119.21699999999998,120.19799999999998,C,"So, shall we both say yes to that?"
120.678,120.85799999999995,UNKNOWN,Yes.
