0.0,3.4610000000000127,C,"Now, what do you think about the map? Because I think I've had a change of heart since I put my answer."
3.9009999999999536,6.581999999999994,R,"Oh, right, okay. What did you think? I put yes."
7.361999999999966,15.985000000000014,C,"I put yes, because it seemed obvious, any kind of map. But then again, it says air map, and looking at it, it seems to show a very small-scale map."
17.226,26.630999999999972,R,"Yeah, and also if we've got the fire to let them know where they are and what's been so far with their location."
27.451999999999998,29.07299999999998,C,"So far nothing, but there's one coming up."
30.19399999999996,30.713999999999942,R,The compass?
31.213999999999942,38.03800000000001,C,"Yeah. If I'm picturing an air map, I don't think it's a lot of use on the ground."
38.75800000000004,39.91899999999998,R,"No, it won't be, will it?"
41.120000000000005,61.908000000000015,C,"So I would like to change my vote to no, what do you think? Just on the grounds that there must be something in this that's a wrong answer, and to me there's only one really obviously wrong answer. And it does say air map, which is quite specific."
62.18799999999999,69.356,R,"Yeah, if it's air map, that would maybe be covered in... air jargon."
70.47699999999998,91.64800000000002,C,"Yes, well I mean at least it's not going to show you the fine detail of rivers and stuff. Because what they want to know on the ground is, is there a river that they can't get across that's coming up? And that would only have to be, that wouldn't have to be a very wide or deep river. I don't imagine that would even show up on an air map, that kind of detail. No, no it couldn't. So I'm going to think that it would just be, that was no use to them. It's made of plastic interestingly, so it's no use as fuel either."
92.14800000000002,92.80899999999997,R,"Say that again, sorry?"
93.06899999999996,96.14999999999998,C,"It's made of plastic interestingly that they say that, so it's not any use as fuel."
97.62099999999998,117.06499999999994,R,"Yeah, and if they've managed to get a close location of the site crash, and also if there's fire in the site crash, they'll know that they're not far from there, and hopefully, through our means of trial and error, we'll come up with a fire which can locate them."
117.58500000000004,124.14599999999996,C,"Generally, with these things, they say you should stay put where you are, because that's where people last heard of you, sort of thing. Yeah, yeah. So, no on that? Cool."
125.00599999999997,125.18700000000001,R,"Right,"
