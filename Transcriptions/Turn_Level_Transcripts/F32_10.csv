0.0,1.86099999999999,R,no. Whiskey. Do you say for whiskey?
2.3419999999999845,6.365000000000009,C,I said no because whiskey brings down your body temperature.
6.384999999999991,8.706999999999994,R,I said yes for lighting stuff.
9.427999999999997,19.932999999999993,C,"Oh god, yes! The whiskey and the cigarette lighter! Yes, you'd need a... How would you light something with it?"
20.312999999999988,24.174999999999955,R,"What have you got that you would... I thought... I don't know, something with a gun."
24.194999999999993,27.996999999999957,C,"Alright, flashes of gun lighting the whiskey."
28.716999999999985,33.89999999999998,R,"I really don't know. That was what I thought, but I didn't know it lowered your body temperature. That would be bad. I didn't know that."
34.55099999999999,53.02499999999998,C,"Yeah, no, if you drink... and if you get drunk out in the wilds too. That's true. But I hadn't thought of the... And the bottle would be very heavy to carry. If they could decant it into something else, that might have been all right."
54.54599999999999,55.706999999999994,R,There was no decanters around.
57.367999999999995,59.99000000000001,C,Put it in the air map. Plastic.
60.00999999999999,70.36500000000001,R,"I don't know that, so maybe it's not the best idea. Because we don't really know how this pistol thing is going to work either, do we? Yes, that's true."
70.38499999999999,78.99099999999999,C,"The chances of getting a flash from the pistol that would set the whisky alight is probably a bit obscure. It's an interesting plan, though."
79.892,89.81899999999996,R,"I don't know how I was thinking to react in movies. Well, I'm happy to say no. I don't know about the temperature thing."
90.33999999999997,94.803,C,"Right. Yes, don't ever go out at night and drink whisky and then get lost in the cold."
