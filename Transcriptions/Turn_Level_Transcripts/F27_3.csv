0.0,0.9410000000000025,C,What about the pistol?
2.5309999999999917,8.855999999999995,R,"I put no, because I'm not sure it's necessary. Like, as you say, maybe there's bears and stuff, I'm wondering now."
9.295999999999992,22.826999999999998,C,"See, I put yes, because I thought there might be some bears, so that way they could shoot the bears if there were any, but I don't know how likely it would be that there would be bears, so I don't know if I'm right by saying... Right, but they might run away."
22.846999999999994,29.492000000000004,R,"What if it's loaded with, like, six bullets, and then there's, like, seven bears that are gonna die anyway?"
30.161999999999992,35.486999999999995,C,"That's true, that's true. How many people have been left on the plane?"
35.507000000000005,42.132999999999996,R,"I don't think it says, does it? Just the pilot and the co-pilot were killed."
47.619,57.56700000000001,C,"seven people, but there were only six bullets, for example, and we maybe wanted to be a higher survival rate for the pistol."
58.428,60.71000000000001,R,"But if there wasn't any bullets, then it's not really necessary."
61.56999999999999,68.49600000000001,C,"Yeah, that's true, that's true. Well, what would you say the consensus was?"
72.40799999999999,84.85399999999998,R,"See, we don't really have... I don't think we can talk about the rest of the things. I think we have to take them in order, so I think this is one that would depend on how many other things we had, but we can't really say that."
85.394,88.916,C,We can't really do that. There's one pistol per person.
89.136,91.39699999999999,R,Or is it just one pistol for everyone?
92.16399999999999,108.15700000000001,C,"What it says, the survivors managed to extract 12 objects from the plane. So I think it's just one pistol. We might as well take it, because we could just put it in our pockets anyway. It's not as if it's just a pistol. It's not like it's a rifle."
108.21699999999998,108.99799999999999,R,It's really heavy.
109.49799999999999,111.34,C,"Yeah, so one of them could just take it."
111.88,112.30099999999999,R,"Right, okay."
112.792,114.172,C,Will we just vote yes out?
114.21199999999999,114.97299999999998,R,"Yeah, we'll go yeah then."
115.53299999999999,116.03299999999999,C,"Oh, okay, that's"
