4.3230000000000075,5.704999999999984,C,For the newspapers I said no.
6.685000000000002,7.186000000000007,R,I said yes.
7.825999999999993,8.006,UNKNOWN,Right.
8.567000000000007,52.668000000000006,R,"But it was because I thought they might be able to use them for kindling or something to make a fire. It depends whether there was enough other stuff that they could actually make a fire. I thought maybe, I asked, I think we're allowed to discuss the other ones in relation to this one. So I think having the lighter without the fluid, you could still, if they took that, they could use the flint to start a fire, perhaps, if they had something dry and kindling. So I thought newspapers might be okay. But that depends whether they would need to make it far. They're not that far away from... I mean, it's 20 miles, but if they could cover it in without having to stay out overnight, then... Yeah, I mean, my thinking is, yes, 20 miles."
52.96799999999999,65.07399999999998,C,"It is extremely cold. But my thinking is that with 20 miles, they could... I'm not sure minus 25 is unbearably cold, but..."
69.15100000000001,103.71000000000001,R,"I think it's hard to tell without knowing what time of day it is. If they're close to night time, then it's probably good to start a fire and stay put. But if it's early in the morning, then I don't think it mentions whether that's the case. The ground is wet, though. That's the only thing. Do you think the extra weight that it would take makes it worth taking them in case they need to make a fire? that they should rule out the idea of making a fire?"
104.59100000000001,130.11599999999999,C,"Well, actually I was going to say that newspaper is light enough that they could carry it if they found themselves in a dry area and they needed heat and they wanted to sit down for... And they'd have the axe so they could get some wood to build the fire up a bit if they wanted to. Yeah, OK, I'll turn around to a yes on that one."
130.43599999999998,132.31599999999997,R,"OK, OK, I'll put yes for that one."
