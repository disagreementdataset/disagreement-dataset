0.0,1.6809999999999832,R,I've said yes for the map.
2.401999999999987,15.657999999999987,C,"Okay. Well, I said no just to reduce the number of items, and they seemed to know where they were. I don't know whether they know the nearest town is 20 miles away, or whether that's just the rescuer."
16.238,18.438999999999993,R,"Oh, I see what you mean, because it says it at the start."
19.099999999999994,38.62899999999999,C,"But they've contacted them, so the rescuer could say to them, the nearest town is this miles away, and further on, they could take the compass, they could say, you know, it's northwest or whatever. I don't know, it's just to reduce the number of items. I know it'd be quite a light item, but... Yeah, because as well,"

48.817999999999984,50.37899999999999,C,"So yeah, they would know to the map."
50.998999999999995,51.218999999999994,R,Okay.
