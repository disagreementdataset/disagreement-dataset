0.0,6.725999999999999,C,"put no for this, but I don't know, what do you think about it?"
8.988000000000056,20.152000000000044,R,"Yeah, I put no as well. I think... I can't think of what the uses could be. In this case, grizzly bears or polar bears or something."
20.91300000000001,27.578000000000088,C,"Unless you're trained in how to use a gun, it's not going to be particularly useful either."
28.079000000000065,28.299000000000092,UNKNOWN,Yeah.
29.040000000000077,30.08000000000004,C,Should we just pin over that then?

36.02500000000009,36.28600000000006,C,Yeah.
37.38700000000006,73.01999999999998,R,"I think... I thought no. I think for The chances of a polar bear or a grizzly bear coming across you and attacking a group of you, especially if you had a fire going, I think a fire would be a deterrent to animals anyway. And even if you didn't, you'd need to be really, really unlucky for a bear to come along and attack a group of people. I don't think it would be used for attracting attention either. So I took no for that."
73.56100000000004,76.18100000000004,C,"Right, yeah, I put no as well, so just get that."
