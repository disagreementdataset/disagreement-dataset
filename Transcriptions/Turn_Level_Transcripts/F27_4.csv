8.723000000000013,13.724999999999994,R,"I don't think, no matter how hungry I was, that I would eat butter, because that's, like, disgusting."
14.344999999999999,16.52600000000001,C,I think I would. I think I definitely would.
16.825999999999993,20.046999999999997,R,"But it's definitely heavy. I mean, you're going to be out there, and if you kill a bear, you can eat the bear."
21.277000000000015,33.22200000000001,C,"Okay. Erm... Yeah, okay, okay. Well, we can just eat the bear. I don't really know why I put butter. But then... No, you can... I'm trying to think what else you could use butter for. Is there anything?"
33.44200000000001,34.22200000000001,R,"Yeah, that's what I was wondering."
34.24200000000002,38.804,C,"Is there something else you could use it for, but... I was ready to say butter fluid, but that's really stupid."
39.04400000000001,45.80600000000001,R,"I'm not convinced. Like, if you're going to go out camping or something, butter isn't the first thing you would take. In fact, I don't even think you would take butter. I think you could survive without it."
46.26600000000002,52.006,C,"Yeah, I would say so, actually. Right, well, will we say no for that one? Yeah."
52.02600000000001,52.90700000000001,R,"Yeah, we'll say no."
54.00800000000001,56.589,C,"Okay. Right, okay."
