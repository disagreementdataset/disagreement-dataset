0.0,2.9609999999999985,C,A pistol?
5.022000000000006,7.382999999999996,R,"Well I put yes, I thought they could use it for signalling."
9.023999999999987,9.583999999999989,C,For what sorry?
10.004000000000005,11.105000000000004,R,Signalling if they needed to.
12.325000000000003,23.58999999999999,C,"Oh right yeah okay, I was suggesting possible food, shooting for food. I know you can't really eat a raw rabbit but yeah I thought you could use it for anything really so."
24.231999999999985,26.632999999999996,R,"And if everything does go wrong, how many of them is that?"
27.87400000000001,31.855000000000004,C,"Yeah, and it's not really that heavy, I suppose."
32.995999999999995,35.596999999999994,R,"It's a bit dangerous, I think, to take, I suppose."
36.95700000000001,46.400999999999996,C,"Yeah, I suppose so. I guess if there's a large group of people, then someone should be able to use a pistol, especially in Canada."
46.88199999999999,61.39399999999999,R,"Yeah, well, it could be anything in the forest, bears and so forth. Yeah, sure, exactly. .45, um... I think that probably has enough stalling power to scare a bear off, but not to kill it, so... Yeah."
61.414,64.056,C,"Um, okay. So we'll put yes for that one."
64.07600000000001,65.097,R,Yeah.
