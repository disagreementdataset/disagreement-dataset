0.0,1.0809999999999889,R,The newspapers.
2.0209999999999866,3.8429999999999893,C,"Yeah, so I was kind of torn on that one as well."
4.382999999999981,5.304000000000002,R,"Oh, is that a pun?"
7.704999999999984,8.98599999999999,C,"I did not mean it like that, but yeah."
9.006,11.787999999999982,R,"This is an emergency situation, no jokes please."
11.867999999999995,13.430000000000007,C,"Yeah, yeah."
13.870000000000005,33.245000000000005,R,"Again, given what else is on the list, I didn't think this was essential. You can see that it might be useful at night as insulation, but they've got each other, so they're going to be generating enough body heat between them to make this unnecessary."
33.946,51.83499999999998,C,"Yeah, that's possible. Also anything like paper is good when you're trying to start a fire. start fire even more easily than something like just starting it with wood or something like that."
52.29499999999999,55.016999999999996,R,"Yeah, yeah, I didn't think about that actually, yeah."
55.67699999999999,67.78399999999999,C,"And also it's not particular, so there's one per person and it's not a particularly cumbersome object, so it could be the kind of thing that's, you know, shoved down the leg of a trouser or something like that, that's kind of easy to transport. Yeah. It could become useful."
68.54399999999998,76.832,R,"Okay, yeah, I'll go along with that actually. I didn't think about the fire starting business at all. I thought about the axe being used to create sparks."
77.65299999999999,78.07299999999998,C,Yeah.
78.75399999999999,86.90199999999999,R,"But I didn't think about what they could use to get the fire going, so I'm happy to change my mind on that one."
87.46199999999999,89.804,C,"Okay, good, cool. So we're both yes on the paper?"
90.26499999999999,90.48499999999999,R,Yep.
91.10499999999999,91.566,C,"Okay, cool."
