2.102000000000004,12.732,R,"Small axe, I wasn't sure but in the end I think I decided yes just for the defence, like safety."
13.453000000000003,33.227000000000004,C,"You put it down for safety, I put it down because it's a wooded area and I'm thinking we've got 20 miles to cover and it's dark, well it's not dark it's probably because there's a lot of snow, but it's wooded and they may need to stop and make a fire either to signal to rescuers or to scare off animals or to keep themselves warm."
33.727000000000004,44.697,R,yeah so I said yes because they might need to chop up timber okay no that makes sense so and yeah defense I guess is another reason so do we agree yes yes okay
