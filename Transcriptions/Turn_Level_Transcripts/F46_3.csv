0.0,13.792000000000002,R,loaded 45 caliber pistol um we're going uh like like I said with defense I didn't think it was necessary to have both an axe and a pistol so okay well I put down there
14.739000000000004,66.957,C,I put yes because I was thinking of that in terms of defence because it's Canada and it's wooded and there might be bears and I thought you'd be better keeping as far away as possible and the other reason I thought I might bring it was because if you couldn't light a fire you could make a noise with it if you thought there were rescuers around I don't know I'm still a little bit equivocal but and I guess I mean I I guess you're right that I'm trying to get rid of a bear with an axe is probably not it's 20 miles I don't know how long it's going to take people to cover that in the dark but if we do need to kill something and eat it maybe I don't know.
