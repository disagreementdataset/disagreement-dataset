15.925000000000011,19.706000000000017,C,"So did I. I thought cutting firewood or whatever. Yep, yep."
22.007000000000005,47.60000000000002,R,"I think there's every possibility in a wooded area that you'll be able to pick firewood off the ground, but I think there's so much you can do with an axe, it's so handy, that yeah, I think it would definitely be worthwhile. And also from the point of view of protection, you'd imagine having something rather than nothing would be a good thing."
48.22000000000003,49.261000000000024,C,"Yeah, so that seems fair enough."
49.968999999999994,51.629999999999995,R,So what were your feelings on it?
51.670000000000016,69.14300000000003,C,"Were you... Yeah, I put it down as a yes. I thought taking it just for chopping firewood or just cleaning up things, like cleaning up the wood to build a decent fire. And I suppose it is a protection."
70.084,71.42500000000001,R,"Yeah, yeah. OK."
71.505,73.54599999999999,C,Are we agreed that that's a yes as well?
74.04700000000003,80.894,R,I think we're agreed that that's a yes then. So that's good. Excellent. It's writing down yes there.
