0.0,3.8029999999999973,C,"Right, the small axe, what did you put for that?"
4.383000000000003,5.103999999999999,R,I put yes.
5.124000000000002,8.165999999999997,C,Is that because of the heavy woodland?
9.405999999999999,20.214,R,"Yeah, because I thought if they're going to try and make a fire or something, or like cut stuff down, it's better to use an axe than to try and use your hands because that could cause cuts."
21.195,21.595,C,"Ah, that's good."
22.214999999999996,22.936,R,What did you put?
23.296,33.279,C,"I actually put no, but I didn't think of the fire aspect. Which is quite, yeah, that's a good idea. How would they light the fire?"
36.1,37.561,R,"Well, with the lighter."
38.101000000000006,39.061,C,Which has no fluid.
39.901999999999994,41.502,R,"No, but does not still create a spark."
42.883,51.246,C,"Oh, I suppose that's true. Okay, that's genius. I'm willing to agree that the small axe is necessary."
51.925999999999995,54.767,R,But the only thing against it is because it's quite heavy.
55.267,55.767999999999994,C,"Well, yeah."
57.211999999999996,59.373,R,But then what if there's an animal that they want to kill?
60.594,61.495,C,That's also true.
61.51499999999999,63.016,R,They could chop it up with that.
66.05799999999999,78.726,C,"Yeah, they could. Well, I mean, there's other sort of food options, so I'm not sure whether they're going to be necessarily hunting in minus 40, but... True."
83.328,86.411,R,"And it is 20 miles, which isn't, I guess, overly far."
86.451,89.09299999999999,C,But fire is probably a good way of them surviving.
89.41300000000001,93.737,R,"Yeah, because I thought, oh, well, because it's wooded and it's not just purely snow."
94.798,98.582,C,"Yeah. Right, OK. I'm willing to accept the axe."
99.22199999999998,100.06299999999999,R,Shall we put yes?
100.243,100.44299999999998,C,Yeah.
101.04399999999998,101.144,UNKNOWN,OK.
