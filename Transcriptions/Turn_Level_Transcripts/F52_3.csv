0.0,0.7010000000000218,R,the pistol.
1.4610000000000127,2.1820000000000164,C,What do you think that is?
2.6820000000000164,6.44500000000005,R,I said yes to kill bears and stuff.
7.086000000000013,26.099000000000046,C,"Right. I put no because it didn't seem, I was sort of thinking of prioritizing. I suppose there's also, I did cross my mind that there might be a way to get a fire out of that, because if you've got ammunition, you feel you can pull apart the bullets and get them. Yeah, that's true."
26.41900000000004,46.72300000000001,R,"If you go back to where they are, in Northern Canada, I just was like, there's loads of bears and stuff, and any predator animals, they need a way, because as much as all these items are great, if a bear comes along and mauls them all, it's all for nothing. So I was like, you need a gun to protect yourself."
47.14300000000003,71.61800000000005,C,"Yeah, I mean, it's not going to do any harm to have it. I suppose the real point of this is that it's like snakes and ladders, isn't it? We're trying to pick the right ones and avoid the wrong ones. The question is, is there any reason why that could be seen as definitely a wrong thing to bring? There's only one item on this list, actually, I can see is definitely not what you'd want. I'm happy to go with a yes if you... I can see the use in it."
72.30800000000005,79.05100000000004,R,"Yeah, I just think that it would be good to protect themselves from any predatory animals."
79.61100000000005,85.17400000000004,C,"Unless they're gonna fall out and start shooting each other, it doesn't do any great harm."
85.55400000000003,93.37700000000001,R,"If it was that thing, where they all shoot each other after they've fallen down? Oh, don't show those loads. Oh, you've got your red images flashing through your mind there."
94.09800000000001,95.75900000000001,C,But you have to do that then.
96.29900000000004,98.88000000000005,R,"Yeah, I'd like to do that. You've talked me round."
98.94000000000005,99.48000000000002,C,One point to you.
