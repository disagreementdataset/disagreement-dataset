9.928,25.2,R,"Yeah, I mean I guess that's the sort of appeal, but I was thinking if they're in a wooded area, there's likely to be, you know, with going down the other items to start a fire, there's going to be likely be needing twigs and things that they can break off their hands, and if it's not essential, not needing to make nice, neat chopping wood, you know?"
25.679999999999996,31.964000000000002,C,"No, I know. I know, there was, I suppose it was the newspapers, so... Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. Jumping a gun there."
32.50399999999999,38.589,R,"No, no, no, no. I'm thinking the same sort of thing, so I think... So I put a no for that one. What did you decide?"

74.329,75.31,C,"Yeah, okay."
75.33,76.89,R,"But as for the accent, so what do you think?"
76.95,84.878,C,"I've said... Yeah, come to think, no, you probably want to get away as quickly get to town as quickly as possible as well, so."
