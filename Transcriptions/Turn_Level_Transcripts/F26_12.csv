0.4800000000000182,5.624000000000024,R,"I take it you were a yes on the chocolate, because... Ah, I was a yes, mostly because, like, eh, you need something to eat."
5.923999999999978,10.086999999999989,C,You've got one per person. They're quite big bars. Can ration them out quite well.
10.106999999999971,13.82899999999995,R,"Erm... Yeah, they're gonna come in handy for that, I know. Somebody tries to rob your chocolate."

18.716999999999985,23.75999999999999,R,"Eh, well they're going to need something to eat in there, so it's either going to be the butter or the chocolate, that's where I was stumped with. Aye."

38.50800000000004,46.03200000000004,C,"I mean, if we've got enough for the butter, then maybe we'll put a yes for the chocolate, you know, because... I've definitely got to get him something to eat in there, can I say? Aye, exactly, aye."
