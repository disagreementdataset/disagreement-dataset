0.0,31.052999999999997,C,"see i said no but then i said yes uh because you could use it as fuel like you could burn it i think um and Maybe I'm an albus, I don't know. I said yes though, because you could use it as fuel, like, I don't know, if they get branched or something, they can put it over it and it will light faster, I think. They can drink it."
33.47399999999993,35.31499999999994,R,Drinking it might not be such a good idea.
36.15499999999997,38.93599999999992,C,"Yeah, it probably is not a good idea. It might keep you warm, I don't know."
41.43299999999999,41.75299999999993,R,Yes.
43.53399999999999,49.89499999999998,C,"Yeah, I'm saying yes because I think... Yeah, I think so."
50.21499999999992,50.83499999999992,R,You're saying yes?
51.79499999999996,55.555999999999926,C,"Well, I think so. Do you have any reason not to?"
58.0569999999999,73.88999999999999,R,"It's heavy. Yeah. And we're already taking quite a lot of things. But I don't know how else you would start a fire with I don't know how you'd start a fire. So, you're saying the whiskey might help?"
74.82999999999993,76.90999999999997,C,I think so. I think it's flammable. I think.
77.69099999999992,85.332,R,"So, but then if you only got the cigarette lighter to light it with, um, with the spark, then, I don't know. Isn't that a bit dangerous?"
85.35199999999998,86.63199999999995,C,"That could be quite dangerous, yeah."
87.072,87.37199999999996,UNKNOWN,Um.
87.81200000000001,88.45299999999997,R,I don't really know.
89.83299999999997,90.19299999999998,UNKNOWN,Um.
90.23299999999995,91.51299999999992,R,I don't know how you'd make a fire.
93.274,93.43399999999997,C,Oh.
95.05399999999997,95.154,UNKNOWN,Hmm.
97.21199999999999,144.45899999999995,C,"Oh man. I don't know. You see it in bare grounds and they always just use wood and they rub it together and it lights. I don't know. Or there's that stuff that's on trees and it's the kind of green mossy stuff and then they always use a wee tiny spark to light that. So I imagine they could figure it out somewhere. So I think the cigarette lighters are still useful. Like, the whisky could keep a fire going though, once they get it lit. Because people add petrol and stuff to fires, and I think whisky and, well, no they're not, but they're both flammable, so I imagine they've got the same kind of qualities. I think yes, just."
144.47899999999993,145.67899999999997,R,"Okay, let's go with yes"
