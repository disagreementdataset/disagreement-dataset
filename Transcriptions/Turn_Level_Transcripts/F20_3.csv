1.3199999999999932,2.219999999999999,C,Okay.
2.6199999999999903,9.942999999999998,R,"I just didn't really know... I don't know, because it's that way you're like, I don't know how long they would need to... They would be waiting."
10.843000000000004,31.48899999999999,C,"Yeah. Yeah, I know what you mean. I guess I thought about that one as well. But then, because they're in Northern Canada, I'm not sure what kind of wildlife is there. And I thought maybe not even just for food or whatever, like sustenance, maybe just in terms of safety, they might want to have it."
31.509,32.509,R,"Oh, that's true."
32.528999999999996,46.391999999999996,C,"I keep on thinking about the weight of things. I'm not sure if that's necessary. But if they just have one and it's loaded, then it's actually useful. And just in case, because, I don't know, is there bears? Probably."

51.99799999999999,59.545,R,"Yeah, I think that would be reasonable. I hadn't even thought of that. I was just thinking for food, but would they really shoot things to eat them?"
60.926,71.831,C,"My first thinking was really awful. I was like, maybe they're going to get it so that they can kill each other for mercy? And I was like, why on earth is that my first thinking? Okay. Right, so shall we say yes?"
72.23100000000001,72.81099999999999,R,"Yes, okay."
73.051,73.29099999999998,C,"Okay,"
