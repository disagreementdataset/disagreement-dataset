0.0,13.007000000000005,R,I said no to the pistol because the pistol is quite heavy and quite limited to supply and if you use it you'll tend to attract attention from animals and things so I think it could be more of a danger aspect and you'll end up running out of bullets. So I said no.
13.821000000000012,22.442000000000007,C,"Okay, possibly. I said yes, but I could go with that. I sort of thought, well, I'll take it, but if it's going to be heavy, I can agree with you."
22.462000000000018,23.802999999999997,R,"Okay, so no for that."
24.063000000000017,24.483000000000004,C,No for that.
