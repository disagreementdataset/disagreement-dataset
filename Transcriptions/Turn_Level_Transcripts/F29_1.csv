0.0,4.6640000000000015,R,let's start with the first one. Ball of Silo. What did you put?
4.863999999999997,6.925999999999995,C,I think we should take it.
7.765000000000001,17.893,R,"I put no, but the one I was stuck on the longest, because in the back of my mind, I've got images of people using balls of steel. I can't think why."
19.655,33.50599999999999,C,"Well, it says they've got several rivers crisscrossing and they're in a wooded area and there's snow. So I wondered whether they'd have to use it to make a shelter."
35.242,58.782999999999994,R,"So they'd use the steel wool to hang the canvas on? I thought the ball of steel wool is like those things that you wash your plates with. Oh yeah! I thought it was more like a thing for friction to get something to... Oh yeah, it's a ball of... That's really stupid of me."
59.342999999999996,63.065000000000005,C,"Okay, yeah, no, you're right. But I wonder whether they could light a fire with that."
63.085,88.519,R,"Yeah, that's what I thought. There'd be some kind of friction heat thing. So that would kind of play into it. In my mind, I'd put no because I said take as little as possible. Yeah. But I could not decide because I thought, oh, something I've heard about this before, I'm sure. Balls of steel were somehow necessary. I can't remember why or where, so I don't know. It's a bit of a risk."
90.08000000000001,112.65700000000001,C,"I suppose if it's quite small. Yeah. I don't know. That's the one I've probably got the most doubt about, because in my mind I feel like I know something about it, but for the life of me I cannot remember why it's necessary. Or maybe it doesn't make fire. What would they rub it against to start a fire?"
113.05700000000002,131.909,R,"Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. Yeah. I almost feel we should move on, because I really think this one's... Because I think what it says, we have to only move on when we've come to a decision, so should we just put no, if we're not sure? Yeah, okay then. I think we'll put no."
132.665,133.245,C,"Okay, no."
