0.0,3.682000000000002,C,"Right, um, I said yes about the axe. The axe?"
3.701999999999998,3.8019999999999996,R,Why?
4.483000000000004,10.446000000000005,C,"Because it said it's like, uh, the countryside is wooded, so I thought they could chop down wood to make a fire, maybe?"
11.047000000000004,20.248000000000005,R,"I was thinking that. I was debating that one. But then I don't know how they're gonna light it. But yeah, because... I don't know how they'd light it, but... They do need wood."
21.429000000000002,27.593000000000004,C,"I know. Because even then, like... I mean, I don't know if it's too far to say they might, like, make a raft to cross the river or something."
28.814000000000007,29.414,UNKNOWN,Hmm.
29.775000000000006,31.055999999999997,C,That seems a bit too much.
32.016000000000005,34.498000000000005,R,Um... They do need wood.
35.479,38.601,C,"But, like, because the signal is empty. It's a small axe, though."
38.661,38.98100000000001,R,Yeah.
39.72200000000001,45.345,C,"And it is a small axe, so it probably isn't too much to carry. What do you think?"
46.446,54.532,R,"I'd know, because I didn't... I didn't really know... Yeah. If they needed to chop anything down in a wooded area."
55.413,68.522,C,"Yeah, because like, the nearest town's 20 miles away, so they probably won't make an overnight... Ah yeah, do you think they will need to stay overnight? I would have thought they'd just maybe try and make like... It's minus 40 though. Yeah."
68.762,69.403,R,They'll just die.
71.084,81.069,C,"Yeah, erm... Because the night time temperature is minus 40. Maybe say no about the small axe then."
81.80900000000001,82.79,R,Do you think?
83.35100000000001,85.752,C,"I feel like it's a risk, not taking it."
88.15400000000001,89.855,R,Is a risk taking it or not taking it?
90.81599999999999,97.39999999999999,C,Surely it's not much more effort carrying a small axe. Maybe they can always ditch it if they realise they can't actually use it for anything.
97.7,100.08200000000001,R,"Yeah, maybe they should take the small axe."
102.163,103.08399999999999,C,Are we saying yes for that?
103.53699999999999,104.378,R,"Yeah, let's go for a yes."
104.95800000000001,105.258,C,Okay.
