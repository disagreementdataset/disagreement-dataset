0.0,6.941999999999993,R,"The pistol, I don't know about today with that one, but I've put doing yes. I mean, it's certainly the Canadian mountains, you've got bears and wolves and all sorts of comfort there, ain't you?"
7.962000000000003,8.561999999999998,UNKNOWN,"Aye, aye, aye."
8.581999999999994,10.162999999999997,R,"It's not just the cold that it could do you in, man."
10.962999999999994,26.855999999999995,C,"Aye, I mean, I've got no, but like, because I don't see much... I mean, aye, I suppose you could use it for that. Aye, just in case, you know, you never know what kind of thing is going to happen. Plus in that kind of situation somebody might go a wee bit doolally. Yep."
27.555999999999997,36.29899999999999,R,"I know, but that's the other thing. That's why I was a bit dubious on it, basically, because it says they're all business types so they probably don't have any experience with guns whatsoever."
37.01899999999999,40.019999999999996,C,"Aye, aye. So what are you thinking?"
40.03999999999999,46.762,R,It is Northern Canada and it's not just the cold weather that's going to do you in. There's a lot of animals up there that would be quite happy to munch you.
47.803,53.488,C,"Aye, I can't be mean. So I put yes for that then, aye? Eh, well that's what I've got. Really, what do you think, man?"
53.908,58.590999999999994,R,"Well, I don't know... I mean, let's say the object has to use as little as possible. Do you know what I mean?"
58.631,59.13199999999999,C,"Aye, aye, true."
59.19199999999999,63.19499999999999,R,"Originally I had millions of yeses and hardly any noes. Do you know what I mean? I was like, right, this isn't looking good."
63.215,65.717,C,Do you know what I mean?
65.97699999999999,66.077,UNKNOWN,Aye.
66.097,68.01899999999999,C,Em... I'm trying to think.
68.039,74.604,R,"Eh... We're not allowed to actually go back, are we? We're supposed to stay on one until we come to a proper decision, aren't we?"
75.104,75.885,C,"I think so, aye."
76.205,76.28499999999998,UNKNOWN,Em...
78.825,85.99,C,I suppose you could use it for protection if there is like any animals and stuff like that up there.
86.73100000000001,91.414,R,"I was just thinking because it's Northern Canada, I mean that place is littered with brown bears, shouldn't it be? And wolves."
92.19500000000001,92.77499999999999,C,"Aye, aye."
92.795,105.46399999999998,R,"It's 20 miles away now, so you're looking at a couple of overnights, deep snow and stuff like that, you're only going a day, but maximum 4 or 5 mile a day. Aye, aye. You're probably only going to be up there for 4 days."
106.70199999999998,111.44500000000001,C,"Ah, definitely aye. I could see- Aye, well, fair enough then, aye. I could take that, aye."
111.52499999999999,114.426,R,"Mm-hmm. Right, we'll go with yes for that one then."
114.746,115.247,C,"Aye, fair is."
115.28699999999999,115.627,R,"Right,"
