13.370000000000005,23.148000000000025,R,"Plus factor. I don't really get, like, would it... What, sorry? I don't really know if the air map would help with navigating on the ground."
23.827999999999975,53.02800000000002,C,"Yeah, I can't imagine it would be very useful, so... But... Hmm. Yeah, well I said no, so... I still said yes, I think it was because I was thinking if, like, if it was marked on it or something, like, where they were in the sky when the plane fell down, then maybe they'd know where they are, but... it wouldn't really help if the pilot and the co-pilot are dead then I guess it doesn't really help for all the business people, they're not going to know how to read it anyway."
53.589,63.39499999999998,R,"Yeah, and they've been able to make a phone call so they could just Yeah, I don't know. I don't know how useful an air map would be."
64.67599999999999,64.83600000000001,C,No.
67.55700000000002,68.89800000000002,R,So are you going for no or yes?
69.39800000000002,69.57799999999997,C,No.
70.17899999999997,75.661,R,No. Okay. That could be a killer one. I don't actually know.
77.78199999999998,102.45499999999998,C,"Yeah, I can't imagine how useful it would be. No, because surely an air map would be like... like, have totally different, like, things, like, it'd be for, like, roads in the sky, I don't even, I don't know how to write it, but, like, they do not really, like, have all that sort of stuff on it, so I can't imagine it's got any, like, actual ground maps, I don't know."
102.47499999999997,113.89899999999994,R,"Well, you'd be able to see, like, where the land and stuff is, I'm sure. And where the sea, I don't know if it would show rivers, it might do. Some information."
115.262,131.40900000000005,C,yeah but it might be like yeah but to be fair they're not going to know like unless it does no they're not going to know it depends how big the scale is on the map like they're not going to know so no i think no um
