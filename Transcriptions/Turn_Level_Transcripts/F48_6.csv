0.0,1.3200000000000216,C,Cigarette lighter without fluid.
2.241000000000014,3.0810000000000173,R,"Um, I said no."
3.8610000000000184,10.244,C,I said yes. And my thinking was that you still better make a spark even if you couldn't make a flame.
12.87100000000001,27.55800000000002,R,"No, I'm not sure. I don't have a huge experience of lighters, so I'm not sure about that one. Because I don't really know if it's useful without fluid."
28.918000000000006,36.041000000000025,C,"Yeah, well it would still spark, it just wouldn't give a long flame, so spark you could still use to light something."

53.422000000000025,59.28800000000001,C,"Yeah, I don't know, but it's kind of the only thing in the list which could potentially light anything."
60.279000000000025,62.119,R,Hmm. I suppose it's quite light.
62.85900000000001,65.42000000000002,C,"Yeah, that's what I was thinking as well. It's not going to weigh anyone down."
65.48000000000002,69.70100000000002,R,"No, that's... Yeah. Okay, I'll give you that one. I'll give you that one. Okay."
70.64100000000002,71.70100000000002,C,"So, let's see. Yes. Um..."
