0.0,0.6809999999999974,R,about the gun then?
2.3629999999999995,5.4879999999999995,C,"I put a no in that, but, you know, I couldn't think of..."
7.248999999999995,37.861999999999995,R,"I actually put a yes, only on the grounds that, obviously it's not essential, they shouldn't need to kill each other, but considering that they are in the north of Canada, and potentially overnight, if there's bears or any sort of wildlife like that, then that might be quite useful should that arise. Because if they're 20 miles away, that's at least a day's worth of walk, or night if it happens to be that, if they want to get there quick enough. So I thought, yes, that might be useful. But you said no, so why did you think no?"
38.543000000000006,57.83499999999998,C,"I don't know, I think there was an element of just, you know, I can see your point about the bear, and I had considered that, but I think there's an element of just, you know, if I had the choice between a gun and something else that might be, you know, like food or something like that, I would take that over."
58.495000000000005,62.918000000000006,R,"If you're pretty convinced on that, then that is one I'm definitely willing to concede, definitely."
63.367999999999995,64.149,C,Okay then. Cool.
64.32899999999998,67.65199999999999,R,"Yeah, so we'll go for no on that then, isn't it?"
67.672,67.97199999999998,C,Yeah. Okay.
