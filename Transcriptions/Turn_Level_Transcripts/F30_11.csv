0.0,0.561000000000007,C,The compass?
1.281000000000006,21.019000000000005,R,"I said yes to the compass, just in case. Well, first of all, I was thinking When I chose the items, I was thinking that they were going to try and walk to the nearest town, but after looking at the bit at the start again, I thought they probably need to stay where they are. So I just said yes to that because I thought they'd need to get directions of how to get to that town, but I don't actually know if it would be useful now."
21.759000000000015,50.60200000000003,C,"Yeah, well, that's the same argument I put yes, but... I think maybe it would be best for them to stay in that spot. It possibly would be, but what if it's really unreachable? the spot. And yeah, there's just no way that a plane could land or whatever to rescue them in that area. Well, they'd probably be rescued by a helicopter maybe, but I don't know, if the T's are too high or something, then they couldn't"
51.41500000000002,52.355999999999995,R,"We couldn't get in, yeah."
52.536,57.30000000000001,C,They couldn't get in or throw down a rope with a wee guy on it.
59.50200000000001,65.46600000000001,R,Maybe they would need it in case you need to get to an open area or something like that.
65.48599999999999,66.90699999999998,C,So you say yes? Yeah.
