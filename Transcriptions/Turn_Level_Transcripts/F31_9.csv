0.0,0.48099999999999454,R,So the map?
1.0009999999999764,2.0809999999999604,C,I've got no for the map.
2.6019999999999754,2.9219999999999686,R,Okay.
3.5219999999999914,4.0020000000000095,C,And you've got?
4.483000000000004,18.312000000000012,R,"I've got yes for it, just because it's, you know, it's dry, it's made of plastic, so it would be waterproof. So it might be helpful to get to where they need to be with this nearby town as well, I don't know."
18.91300000000001,26.235000000000014,C,"Well, the thing I thought was it's an air map, so I thought it wouldn't be, you know, they would have absolutely no idea where they were and they couldn't pinpoint it."
26.454999999999984,36.69900000000001,R,"That's true, and they don't know how big an air map it is, like how far, how much land it covers, because if it's a world map then it's not going to be of any use."
36.87899999999996,48.64499999999998,C,"Yeah, maps are probably only used for the planes, but the only other thing is that maybe it's useful for something else, because it is a piece of sheeting that's made of plastic, but that's the only thing I could think of if it wasn't going to be."
48.685,56.44799999999998,R,"It would probably be light, but it's hard to know how big it is. I'm happy to say no for that one if you think, I don't know."
