0.0,0.46000000000000085,R,I said no.

2.761000000000003,16.223000000000006,C,"Well, I thought to myself, well, it is a heavily wooded area. Countryside is wooded with several rivers. I thought there might have been a chance that they might have needed to use the axe to chop little bits of wood to make a fire, maybe, or just to get through the heavy wooded area if there was little bits they couldn't cross."
16.92300000000001,25.945,R,"I was thinking that if they did need to make a fire, they could just snap off branches. The axe wouldn't be having to fall trees. Absolutely."
26.025,29.226000000000006,C,"No, that makes perfect sense. Little twigs and stuff, I'm sure, would be absolutely fine."
30.666000000000004,31.386000000000003,R,"So, we'll go no?"
31.987000000000002,34.809000000000005,C,"Yeah, let's go for no then. Okay."
