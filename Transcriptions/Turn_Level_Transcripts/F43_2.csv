6.237000000000023,20.502999999999986,R,"Right, and mine were no, because if it's small, and they're in big woods, it would take them ages even to knock down one tree, and it's a small axe, it's not really going to be incredibly much use to them, and also it's quite heavy."
21.423000000000002,41.759000000000015,C,"Yeah, the thing is, I was thinking, if it's a small axe, it's not going to be that heavy, that heavy, that one person was going to carry it, And and so you've got a kind of pine trees where you've got small branches that you might be quite handy to kind of hack off Because the main thing I was thinking was fires I"
47.94200000000001,48.341999999999985,R,fires?
48.72199999999998,58.75200000000001,C,Yeah like to make it obviously if they're going to be out at night and the temperature is going to be minus 40 they should make a fire. That's right I thought exactly the same.
58.77199999999999,62.396000000000015,R,Are we not allowed to discuss the items further down are we?
62.81600000000003,63.577,C,No we aren't.
63.95800000000003,81.45499999999998,R,"So hacking down some branches for a fire would be a very good thing if if they've got to stay out all night, and they're not dressed in good clothes. And they've got smart shoes as well, so the walking will be difficult."
81.81600000000003,88.44299999999998,C,"Yeah, so it could be handy for knocking branches out of the way if they're walking, to make a way through."
90.22500000000002,93.48700000000002,R,"Yeah, you're probably right on that then. Okay, I'll give you that one. We'll put it there."
94.048,94.28800000000001,UNKNOWN,Okay.
94.32800000000003,97.26999999999998,R,"Okay. So that's the trick, that's your chief in mind."
97.32999999999998,111.13900000000001,C,"I just thought, because I do a lot of walking out in the Highlands and stuff, and when I get to Bothe that's got an axe in it, I'm always really grateful that there's an axe there. Right, yeah. Because I think that it's really handy to make fire with."
111.80099999999999,119.98899999999998,R,"Yes, as long as it's cheese, yes, or dry cheese. With all the snow then the wood would probably be pretty wet anyway."
120.149,124.33300000000003,C,"That's right, well let's agree to yes on that."
124.51299999999998,125.53399999999999,R,"Okay, that's fine."
