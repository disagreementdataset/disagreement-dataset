0.0,1.7020000000000053,R,"Okay, so a small axe."
2.352000000000004,3.112000000000002,C,I put yes.
3.7520000000000024,4.792000000000009,R,"Oh right, okay, I put no."
5.193000000000005,5.493000000000002,C,Okay.
6.633000000000003,8.353000000000002,R,"How did you, where did you think that was?"
8.693000000000005,25.235999999999997,C,"I was just thinking, if it, because it doesn't really say, sort of, then like, yeah, like a wooded area, well I suppose, yeah, I was thinking like they could make some sort of shelter and they wouldn't have anything that was sharp enough maybe to cut anything else."
25.856,30.457,R,"To cut any wood or stuff like that, okay. So you think that they would need a shelter?"
31.357000000000006,32.177,C,I think so.
32.317,33.498,R,"From where they are, yeah."
33.558,44.66100000000001,C,"Yeah, because if it's overnight as well, because it doesn't say what time it is, but just because it said the night time temperature is expected to be 40 degrees. Minus 40 degrees!"
44.721,73.168,R,"I can definitely see why an axe would be good. But I'm just thinking, it doesn't say anybody's injured, and I would assume that they want to get moving again, and they're only 20 miles away, they would want to just get to the town as soon as possible. But if they were obliged to spend the night, I don't know, to wait for light the next day, they would definitely need a shelter. So I don't know."
74.78900000000002,97.64700000000002,C,"But I suppose if they're in a wooded area, depending on what else they have with them, they could probably find shelter without that axe. right so do you think no for that one as well um my initial thought was no um that's fine we'll go with no so it was no okay yeah i'm easy for that one There were a few that I wasn't too sure about."
97.767,100.18800000000002,R,"Me neither, it's hard to know what to choose."
