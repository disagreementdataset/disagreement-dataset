0.0,1.100999999999999,R,was your opinion for the pistol?
1.978999999999985,13.288999999999987,C,"My opinion was no, because what would you need it for? Hunting or for defence? But realistically, you're probably not going to get attacked if you're in a group that big."
14.20999999999998,26.079999999999984,R,"That was my opinion as well. I put yes on account of potentially so, but then from expert knowledge, I also know that a pistol is of almost no use at all against the likely bear or wolf attack in that part of the world."
26.661,29.022999999999968,C,"You don't think it would be useful for attracting attention, do you?"
30.337999999999965,57.30000000000001,R,"Potentially so, I presume. In fact, actually, that would probably be a very good point. It actually probably could be very, very useful for attracting attention. So on the grounds of attracting attention, I actually quite agree, it probably would be very useful, and it certainly wouldn't do them any harm. So in fact, being relatively small, I would probably recommend taking that, to be honest. They have it for defence, if necessary, but also for that reason as well."
58.551999999999964,64.83699999999999,C,"Yeah, I suppose when we get within earshot of the town, they can then use that to attract attention."
64.85699999999997,66.298,R,Yeah. I guess.
67.07900000000001,70.46199999999999,C,"Okay, let's put yes for that because it might reduce the distance they have to travel."
71.12200000000001,71.84299999999996,R,Sounds good to me.
