2.3110000000000355,21.86000000000007,R,"Well, a compass, instinctively, seems like a good idea, but without a map for some sort of reference point, that usefulness factor seems to me, at first sight, in a way, reduced. How do you think a compass would come in useful?"
22.88100000000003,55.22300000000001,C,"Well, the effectiveness is that one could know the areas. They could head in a certain direction without going around in a circle. um yeah my my idea was that if someone knows the area they could head in a certain direction they more likely knew where they were heading when the plane crashed they might have no idea where they are now but at least they have an idea of maybe what area what way to head it says in the message"
56.516999999999996,74.56599999999997,R,"The nearest town is 32.2km away. So they definitely have got a reference point, they definitely know where they are. I don't know how they actually know that because the pilots did, the co-pilots did, but the information on the message is that they must know where they are to know that the nearest town is 20 miles away."
76.06800000000004,84.09100000000007,C,"So yeah, so then I'm assuming that they do know their direction, or they know where they are, so then they must know where that city is. In that case, the compass would become useful."
84.11100000000005,87.95200000000006,R,"So the compass would help them get to those. Yes, we've got a different color, yes?"
88.37200000000001,88.632,C,Yes.
89.53199999999998,89.77199999999999,R,Okay.
