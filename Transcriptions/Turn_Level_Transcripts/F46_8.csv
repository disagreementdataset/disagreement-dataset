0.0,20.829999999999927,R,what did you think about a canvas I hesitated on that one because I thought you obviously don't want to be hanging around and setting up camp because you know you want to be out of the woods as soon as possible but it is a long way and when you do sit still you probably want protection
22.176999999999907,50.43999999999994,C,okay I said no simply because it was pretty large and I thought we weren't going to stop by choice and I thought we might be able to find some shelter by you know if we've got the axe we could use wood or something or just keep moving to keep well I just thought that I wouldn't want to stop I couldn't think of any use for it apart from shelter or putting under you yeah I was thinking of shelter because I thought can you do
51.54299999999989,66.85199999999998,R,What is it? Can you do 20 miles without stopping? Uh-huh. But what you said about using the axe to make shelter out of wood is probably better than carrying around the canvas.
67.41199999999992,68.63299999999992,C,Uh-huh. Okay.
69.21299999999997,71.63499999999999,R,"Okay, so I'd put yes, but I think I'm going to put no."
72.15499999999997,75.87699999999995,C,"Okay, well I had put no, so if you're happy with that, I'm going to put no. Okay."
