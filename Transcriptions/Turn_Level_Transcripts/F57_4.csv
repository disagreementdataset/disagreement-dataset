0.0,0.6209999999999809,C,A can of butter.
1.6019999999999754,5.183999999999969,R,"Yeah, a can of butter. So, what did you have for this one?"
5.604000000000042,5.784999999999968,C,Yes.
6.524999999999977,35.12800000000004,R,"You had yes? I had yes as well. Well, I think we had the same answers for all of them, it's just I'm changing my mind. I had yes because it's an extremely good source of fat, which if you're out in the freezing cold, it'd be certainly very good to eat that. And obviously it looks like a big can of butter. I don't think, I mean like, Arctic explorers generally eat lard and things like this, so I just thought the butter was good in that sense."
35.749000000000024,37.00999999999999,C,"Yes, I thought it was good as well."
37.610000000000014,45.014999999999986,R,"I'm trying to think of other uses for the butter, like... I thought... Lubricating things."
46.014999999999986,56.162000000000035,C,"Well, I thought of that, but not necessarily, I mean, as an extra insulator, actually. Yeah, that's true, that's true. I mean, if people are going to get wet, then it acts as an extra insulation on top of the skin."
56.894000000000005,71.68399999999997,R,"Yeah. No, that's actually, that's potentially a good use. I mean, I think just like the food alone is enough for me to say yes, because it's high calorific value. So I mean, I think we're both saying yes on this one."
72.06499999999994,73.64599999999996,C,Okay. Yeah. Yep.
