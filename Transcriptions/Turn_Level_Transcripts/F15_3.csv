1.3800000000000097,2.4810000000000088,R,Third one I've put yes.
3.341000000000008,20.965000000000018,C,"I've also put no for that as well. You've put no for that? I can see where that would come in useful, based on that they are, eh, they're in Northern Canada, and I was just thinking, cause they're out, eh, in the countryside in a wooded area, there's a chance they could come across bears."
21.945000000000007,25.546000000000006,R,"That's what I was thinking, that's why I put yes for that, in case they had to ward off the bears."
26.150999999999996,41.73899999999999,C,"See, the thing is though, the other items I've got down, I still consider them more important and there is the chance of coming across a bear, but there's also the chance that they won't see any bears at all. So I see the gun as completely 50-50, whether it be needed."

51.384,59.188,R,"There's probably other uses for the gun as well, like if they need to make a noise, For example, a loud noise, so use it as a flare almost?"
60.949,62.29100000000001,C,You mean like to attract attention?
62.31099999999999,68.677,R,"Uh-huh, if they're ever found, you know, or not found, but if they're ever going to be found, you know?"
68.717,69.39800000000001,C,"See,"
