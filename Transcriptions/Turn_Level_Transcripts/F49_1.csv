8.482,52.023,R,"Well, I was actually here a few minutes before you, and I've since been wondering, I don't know whether you're allowed to actually refer to items down the list, I know it's got to be each one in turn, but whether actually a ball of steel wood could be used as a torch. The can of butter could maybe be used as grease mixed with the steel wool. to provide a torch using the lighter to spark a flame used by the whisky. I rejected all these things. I was sitting here waiting and I thought I wonder if you could actually do that or whether it would just be a waste of time. So I initially said no as well. So are you happy to stay with that?"
52.043,58.928000000000004,C,Yeah I'm happy to stay with no because although you could maybe use it as a torch I think there's other things on the list that are more important.
59.782000000000004,63.38399999999999,R,"Yep, so, yeah, I'll go when they're in, I'm happy with that."
