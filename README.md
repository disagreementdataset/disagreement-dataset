# Disagreement Dataset

## Repository Structure
- `Audio/`: The folder that contains the audio files for all clips. Clips are in `.wav` format, sampled at 16 kHz. Naming matches the `File name` column in `metadata.csv`.
- `Transcriptions/`: The folder contains automatic transcriptions at both the turn and word level
    - `Turn_Level_Transcriptions/`: This folder contains transcripts including each speaker turn for a given clip
    - `Word_Level_Transcriptions/`: This folder contains transcriptions with a row for each word and timing information.
  The `.csv` files have the same naming convention as the audio files.

- `metadata.csv`: This file contains the clip-level labels and `Fold` for the cross-validation protocol. See the column descriptions for 'metadata.csv' below.
